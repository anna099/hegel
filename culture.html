<h2 id="spirit">Spirit</h2>
<h3 id="alienated-spirit-culture">Alienated Spirit: Culture</h3>
<p>In an interesting passage of his early work <em>The Spirit of
Christianity and its Fate</em>, Hegel gives an analysis of the Last
Supper.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> He writes of the ‘bond of
friendship’ and the acts that actualise friendship and love, and he
takes the sharing of Jesus’s cup to be a paradigmatic case of such acts.
But the passage is most interesting because it is one of Hegel’s
earliest examinations of <em>spirit</em>. ‘Objectively considered, then,
the bread is just bread, the wine just wine; yet both are something
more’: in the Last Supper, as Hegel understands it, we see things take
on a significance beyond their natural existence – that is, we see
<em>spirit</em> arise from out of nature. We do not have to be religious
to understand his point, since we can interpret it as an allegory: in
the bread and wine that Jesus offers, Hegel writes, the <em>spirit</em>
of Jesus ‘has become a present object, a reality, for external feeling’.
Then, in the consumption of the bread and wine, the spirit that has
become objective ‘reverts once more to its nature, becomes subjective
again in the eating’. Hegel gives another analogy, this time
non-religious: ‘This return may perhaps in this respect be compared with
the thought which in the written word becomes a thing and which
recaptures its subjectivity out of an object, out of something lifeless,
when we read.’ Both the Last Supper and the act of reading have the same
structure: something internal (Jesus’s spiritual presence, or the
thought of a writer) is <em>externalised</em>, and then (through the
eating or reading carried out by the Other) is <em>re-internalised</em>
and takes on a new significance.</p>
<p>This motif – of going outside of oneself and then returning – is
precisely how spirit comes on the scene. Now, in the
<em>Phenomenology</em>’s sixth chapter, we are concerned with spirit in
a more sophisticated sense: spirit is not here restricted to a small
group of disciples or to a writer and reader, but is something
permeating societies in general. The harmonious society of Greece was
the site of spirit in its first, immediate existence. Now, before we
reach the existence of spirit as self-conscious in and for itself, we
must work through its second moment, its externalisation out of itself:
that is, its <em>alienation</em>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Cultural alienation, as we will see, bears a strong resemblance to
unhappy consciousness. Indeed, I would argue that this chapter can be
understood as Hegel’s analysis of unhappiness on a <em>social</em> or
<em>spiritual</em> scale, broader than on the individual scale of the
self-consciousness chapter. What it means to be alienated is that
self-consciousness and its ethical substance – that is, the individual
and society – are in a conscious ‘unity’ (as opposed to the unconscious
unity of true spirit in Greece) but nonetheless experience some kind of
separation from each other. In other words, the individual recognises
themselves as part of a society, as a constituent of their social
environment, but nonetheless does not <em>feel at home</em> in this
society. This runs parallel to unhappy consciousness wherein the subject
felt alienated from a ‘God’ who – unbeknownst to them – was within them
from the start. By alienating the individuals that constitute it, the
‘substance’ of the social world ‘is itself its own self-relinquishing’:
it splits itself into two, externalising what is internal to it.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This is precisely how ethical
substance, <em>as spirit</em>, moves into its second stage: in
undergoing this externalisation, alienation, or self-relinquishing, it
ascends from out of its immediate existence (which we saw in Greece) and
awaits the return into itself through which it will reach its truth.</p>
<p>Because of this similarity, and because of what preceded this
chapter, we might be inclined to think that here Hegel is thinking of
Christianity as it came to flourish following the conversion of
Constantine. However, we also know that Hegel took the alienation
described in this chapter as a defining characteristic of
<em>modernity</em>, and his explicit references (to the Enlightenment,
the French Revolution and the Terror) suggest that he is thinking of the
modern era. Robert Solomon argues that the <em>Phenomenology</em> simply
jumps from Rome to modernity – a ‘glaring omission’ that proves to us
that Hegel is not attempting a literal history.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
Fredric Jameson agrees that Hegel makes an omission, but only because
medieval times were the subject of the unhappy consciousness chapter.<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> On the other hand, Terry Pinkard
argues that Hegel, unlike his contemporaries, did not think of the
ancient era as separated from modernity by the so-called ‘Middle
Ages’.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> On this view, for Hegel as for
Nietzsche, the first signs of modernity are present in the birth of the
Christian conception of selfhood; as such, when I refer to ‘modernity’
in the Hegelian context, this should be understood as <em>including</em>
the medieval era. So, while Solomon is partially right – the
<em>Phenomenology</em> is not a literal history, as I have explained
above – he is wrong to find an ‘omission’ in the book. The present
chapter takes us on a route from medieval Christianity through the
Enlightenment and up to the climax of the French Revolution, in a manner
that, admittedly, may be more logical than chronological.</p>
<p>To close the introductory section of this chapter, Hegel gives a
summary of the entire section in one long paragraph. Spirit has become
divided, opposed within itself, and gives way to ‘a doubled world’.<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Although the world is present before
us, its <em>essence</em> is understood as belonging to some ‘beyond’ –
everything thus ‘receives actuality from an other’. Individuals in
self-alienated spirit take the <em>truth</em> of the world to be
separated from the world they inhabit, postponed to a realm beyond life.
The premodern world was divided (for instance, into human and divine
law), but its inhabitants didn’t acknowledge this divide because they
immediately identified with it, on the basis of ‘nature’. In alienated
modernity, people actually <em>acknowledge</em> these dualisms and
attempt to cope with them by conceptually comprehending them in various
ways. <strong>Cultural formation</strong> (<em>Bildung</em>) is Hegel’s
name for this coping, for conducting one’s life according to these
dichotomies that the alienated individuals have posed. These individuals
attempt to transform their selfhood (as the characters in
<em>Bildungsromane</em> do) in order to align themselves with the ‘good’
side of a dichotomy – or, as Taylor puts it, ‘to close the gap between
themselves and social reality.’<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, all such attempts prevent a <em>real</em> unity with the
world and keep the individuals from being at home in their world. This
is why, in Hegel’s words, whenever the individual of culture enters ‘the
actual world’ they always ‘pass over again back into actual
self-consciousness’.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The dualisms they construct in order
to cope with an unwelcoming actually plunge them back into thought,
closing them off from the world by rendering it as an ‘<em>other-worldly
beyond</em>’.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> (This is yet another similarity
with unhappy consciousness.) Hyppolite notes that Hegel’s inclusion of
alienation within an account of cultural education is a challenge to his
contemporaries (such as Herder, who did the most to introduce the notion
of <em>Bildung</em> into German philosophy).<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
For classical Enlightenment thinkers, the individual undergoes education
in straightforward upward progress, and for ‘humanist pedagogy’ nature
undergoes a harmonious development within the human being. For Hegel,
however, to undergo formation and education involves a movement of
self-inequality and distance from oneself – this is precisely the
externalisation I described above.</p>
<!-- Unfinished:
Even though the cultural formation of alienated spirit comes to fail, this does
not mean that Hegel is opposed to all cultural formation, all kinds of
*Bildung*. In his preface, he describes the *Phenomenology* itself as a process
of *Bildung* multiple times.[^10.1]
-->
<p>After the dissolution of the most immediate form of cultural
formation, spirit undergoes two more shapes, both of which are still
based on systems of dichotomies. Firstly, spirit adopts a worldview
wherein the world is taken as untrue in contrast to a harmonious beyond,
posited by <strong>faith</strong>, ‘which has no actual present’.<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Secondly, when this faith is
interpreted in the secular terms of the <strong>Enlightenment</strong>,
the ‘housekeeping of faith’ is brought into ‘disarray’ as the present
world is comprehended coldly in terms of <em>utility</em>, and the
beyond is taken to be utterly unknowable ‘<em>absolute essence</em>’.
Though the Enlightenment robs the world of any substantiality, promoting
only the equally empty worldviews of deism or materialism, the priority
it affords to the actual individual paves the way for the
<strong>absolute freedom</strong> exhibited in the French Revolution,
through which spirit ‘abandons this land of cultural formation and
crosses over into another land, into the land of <em>moral
consciousness</em>.’</p>
<h4 id="form">Cultural Formation and its Realm of Actuality</h4>
<p>The world of culture, as Hegel sees it, is one wherein individuals
are equal. This equality is not established through legal status or
legal status or through mutual recognition, but through each
individual’s equal alienated conformity to the universal. Everyone
relinquishes their individuality – gives up their desires,
personalities, and so on – in order to bring the world to its actuality
and achieve oneness with the beyond. Seeing the world as something
alien, cultural individuals aim not to belong in the world but to ‘take
possession’ of it, precisely by mastering nature (especially their own
natural existence) according to God’s will.<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
<em>Bildung</em> is the name for this mastery – a word we have seen
before, when the servant of self-consciousness worked with its natural
body upon the natural world and, in so doing, became the <em>master</em>
of both. The difference now is that the object of <em>cultural</em>
mastery is not just a discrete, isolated thing, but is instead wrapped
up in the context of social substance.</p>
<p>By carrying out their life in this way, the individual comes to
realise that their ‘actuality still solely consists in their sublation
of [their] natural self.’<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> We should therefore
understand ‘culture’ as that element of life which Rousseau was so upset
about, through which ‘everything degenerates in the hands of man.’<a
href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Unlike Rousseau, the individual at
this stage of the <em>Phenomenology</em> venerates culture and is
dismissive of nature: they regard individuality as ‘falsely posited as
lying in the <em>particularity</em> of nature’; individuality is rather
found in alienated <em>Bildung</em>, in the grand world of culture that
looks with contempt upon the lowly world of our natural existence. The
cultured individual urges us to forget the ‘powerless’ and ‘non-actual’
contingencies of nature; insofar as we are engaged in cultural
formation, they claim, we are all equal before God. (This is the
equality of ‘conformity’ that I introduced above.) The contrast to
Rousseau might remind us of Rousseau’s once friend, turned rival, Denis
Diderot. For Rousseau, education ought to liberate us from the ‘chains’
that society and culture have imposed on us: ‘What must be done is to
prevent anything from being done.’<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Diderot, however, saw
education as something positive. In §488 Hegel quotes Diderot’s
<em>Rameau’s Nephew</em> (which he will return to further on), and
characterises Diderot as an ‘honest’ self-consciousness who strives to
overcome nature in seeking the universal through culture.</p>
<p>Without being aware of it, the individual still has a relation to the
social world that it feels alienated from. In the process of cultural
formation, ‘the individual empties itself of its own self’ – that is,
renunciates its pre-cultural characteristics – and <em>gives itself
over</em> to culture (or, more precisely, to the institutions,
communities, and practices that embody culture).<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
‘Hence,’ Hegel writes, ‘its cultural formation and its own actuality are
the actualization of substance itself.’ Although the individual takes
‘culture’ to be an alien essence, instituted by God’s will, it is in
fact <em>constituted</em> by the individual’s <em>Bildung</em>.</p>
<p>What shape does this constitution take? The individual, which still
lives along the dualistic lines of unhappy consciousness, divides social
substance up into opposing parts which exist through their opposition to
one another. The ‘thinking’ of cultured individuals, Hegel explains,
establishes the <em>difference</em> between these two parts by
identifying one as ‘good’ and the other as ‘bad’.<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
The individual thus acts like the ‘soul’ of their society, attempting to
understand its structure and development by fixing it into rigid
categories. In this sense, the individual actually understands
themselves <em>not</em> as an individual first and foremost, but instead
as a living expression or articulation of the culture they live in –
since, for now, they do not realise that they themselves constitute this
culture. We will see the downfall of this form of individuality when
each ‘moment’ it posits of society – ‘good’, ‘bad’, or whatever else –
passes into its opposite and the entire categorisation is
undermined.</p>
<p>The first form of categorisation Hegel presents us with breaks
society up into various estates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as nature explicates itself into universal elements, under which
fall [air, water, fire, and earth] … In this way, the inner
<em>essence</em>, or the simple spirit of self-consciousness actuality,
explicates itself into just those kinds of universal, though spiritual,
social estates.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a strange claim. The parallel drawn between a natural
division (the four elements) and a social division (the estates) might
remind us of the Greek system of human and divine law being based on
‘natural’ gender distinctions, and this resonance is prboably
intentional. The difference here, however, is that in this passage Hegel
is presumably only giving an <em>analogy</em>, rather than a causal
explanation. Nonetheless, the characteristics that he attributes to each
of the four elements are comparable with the characteristics of the
social estates he describes.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Air</em>: the element which <em>endures</em> and in which
‘everything individual is sublimated’ – corresponding to the social
essence as it is purely in itself and equal to itself, and the
‘<strong>state power</strong>’ which renders individuals as uniform.<a
href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Water</em>: the element which stands for ‘the real possibility
of difference’, which in its form is ‘ever sacrificed’ rather than
enduring – corrseponding to the social essence as it is <em>for</em>
itself, unequal to itself and self-sacrificing, manifest in
‘<strong>wealth</strong>’, the social form of free consumption and
self-interest.</li>
<li><em>Fire</em>: the element of ‘individuality existing on its own
account’, ‘a self-relating negativity’ – corresponding to the social
essence existing in <em>and</em> for itself, giving way to the rise of
real subjectivity and self-consciousness. The ‘force of fire’ in a
society is thus its latent potential for a revolution which will come
about only when its estates (‘state power’ and ‘wealth’) are recognised
as dissolving into one another.</li>
<li><em>Earth</em>: the element distinct from all the others which is
‘indeterminate’ but nonetheless is ‘the totality which holds together’
the other elements – corresponding to social essence <em>as such</em>,
the ground ‘from which [social phenomena] start and to which they
return.’</li>
</ol>
<p>The cultured world is thus divided into two estates: state power
(which Harris identifies with ‘public service’ in general) and wealth.<a
href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> In keeping with its unhappy
dualism, cultural consciousness quite clumsily comes to regard the
former as <em>good</em> and the latter as <em>bad</em>. State power is
understood as the ‘unchanging <em>essence</em>’ grounding all
individuals, while wealth is the institution through which individuals
come to realise themselves <em>as</em> singular individuals – and, since
culture despises self-interest and prioritises the ‘general’ good, it
looks with disdain upon wealth.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Again, this is
consistent with a Christian view of society: Augustine divides the world
in a similar manner, into two ‘cities’, one that lives by the standard
of ‘flesh’ (that is, indviidualistic human affairs) and the other by the
standard of ‘spirit’. ‘The earthly city was created by self-love
reaching the point of contempt for God, the Heavenly City by the love of
God carried as far as contempt of self … The former looks for glory from
men, the latter finds its highest glory in God, the witness of a good
conscience.’<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>This division is not so rigid, however. We saw in unhappy
consciousness that the believer who surrendered themselves to God was
actually self-obsessed, taking pains over their ‘willing, acting, and
consuming’, and we learned in the animal kingdom that activity that
<em>seems</em> purely individualistic is in fact always public, always
dissolved into ‘the doing of each and all’.<a href="#fn24"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
In the same way, the ‘self-interest’ of wealth actually benefits
everyone in its production of <em>common</em> wealth; ‘each in his own
consumption benefits everyone else.’<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Likewise, state power
is the source of social stability in which everyone is able to find and
express their individuality. Both estates are intrinsically related to
one antoher, and self-consciousness thus realises its capacity to
<em>choose</em> between the two (or, indeed, to choose neither of them).
Do I want a life of pbulic service, or of making wealth? With regards to
the elemental analogy above, therefore, <em>self-consciousness has
become fire</em> in its capacity to choose and judge between the dual
sides of society.</p>

<p>Self-consciousness’s judgment is conditioned by its alienation; it
<em>judges</em> society because it regards society as an external
<em>object</em> from it. If it ‘finds itself’ within the object – that
is, if it feels at home within it – it regards it as <em>good</em>. On
the other hand, ‘the object in which it finds its own opposite is
[judged to be] bad.’<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Self-consciousness is therefore
seeking ‘happiness’, as Kant defined it: ‘the harmony of nature with his
whole end.’<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> The objects of this judgment are
the same as before – state power and wealth – and, at first, it judges
wealth to be the good. On this understanding, state power is an
oppressive force that rids people of their capacity for individual
expression; wealth, on the other hand, is the realm of consumption and
production wherein everyone is able to express themselves, while still
nonetheless contributing to society – wealth ‘gives itself away and
gives to everyone a consciousness of their selves.’<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
This liberal judgment is made, Hegel claims, on behalf of
self-consciousness as it is <em>for-itself</em> – that is, the
individual insofar as they are concerned with their individuality and
outward expression.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the individual can also judge society on behalf of
their existence <em>in-itself</em>: on this more communitarian
understanding, state-power is the good. It is the ruling power of the
state that gives order to our lives and establishes a context in which
we are able to act at all; through the state I find my ‘ground and
essence expressed, organized, and activated.’<a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>
From this perspective, wealth only begets a ‘transitory’ existence
wherein individuals ‘enjoy’ themselves in isolated and specific
senses.</p>
<p>This first kind of judgment seems to have reached an impasse. ‘There
is a twofold <em>finding-of-equality</em> and a twofold
<em>finding-of-inequality</em>,’ Hegel writes: given that the individual
has two dimensions, it is always able to compare social estates with
just one of these dimensions at a time and end up contradicting itself
when it reorients its judgment.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> It is therefore
necessary to progress to a higher form of judgment: namely, one which
takes the self to be <em>in-and-for-itself</em>, and reflectively takes
the self as its object. The criterion of judgment – namely, do I ‘find
myself’ within society? – remains the same. The individual either feels
themselves participating in state-power and wealth as an <em>equal</em>
to these institutions, and thus is classed as a ‘noble’ consciousness,
or otherwise they find themselves to be <em>unequal</em> in the face of
these institutions are are classed as ‘base’ [<em>niederträchtige</em> –
sipteful, contemptuous, or mean].<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> The noble
consciousness acts with an air of obligation, gratitude, and respect for
society’s institutions; the base consciousness, on the other hand,
‘hates the ruler and only obeys him with concealed malice’ and, seeing
the pervasion of wealth inequality, is eager for revolt.<a href="#fn32"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em>Rameau’s Nephew</em>, Diderot presents a dialogue between
‘Moi’ (<em>me</em>) and ‘Lui’ (<em>him</em> – young Rameau). Moi is a
<em>philosophe</em>; he values culture, music, and writing, and praises
education for allowing us to overcome the ‘delicate constitution’ in our
nature.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> Rameau, on the other hand, is an
erratic hedonist; he deplores the inequality of the world, where some
people ‘can’t even find a crust to chew on’, and he mocks the
<em>philosophes</em> for their pretensions.<a href="#fn34"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>
As Alasdair MacIntyre writes, ‘Where the <em>philosophe</em> sees
principle, the family, a well-ordered natural and social world, Rameau
sees these as sophisticated disguises for self-love, seduction and
predatory enterprise.’<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> It seems that Hegel’s introduction
of the noble and base consciousness is inspired by Diderot’s novel; both
Rameau and the <em>philosophe</em> occupy the same world, but they judge
it in completely opposite ways, and in this way Rameau resembles the
base consciousness.</p>
<p>At the end of <em>Rameau’s Nephew</em>, the two men finish their
conversation and part ways. Things are not quite so simple in the
<em>Phenomenology</em>, since these two forms of judgment still only
concern the social estates as they are in themselves. To be sure, the
judging individuals are self-conscious in and for themselves, but their
judgment is born out of the fact that they simply <em>confront</em>
state power and wealth as lifeless essences, ‘predicates which are not
yet themselves subjects’.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> Public service and
self-interest are just goals in the abstract; they are not yet
concretised in institutions or embodied by communities. This, Hegel
argues, is the reason for spirit being in two halves (noble and base) in
this stage of its development. To overcome this split, and to overcome
the division between the individual and the estates that they judge,
both essence and judgment will enter into a syllogism. (Here,
incidentally, is a good example of Hegel’s characteristic approach to
logic: logical order for him is not something imposed on
<em>reality</em>, nor is it <em>extracted</em> from reality; rather,
existence itself, being a living process, exhibits its own logic; the
task of us as philosophers is to keep track of this logic.) This
syllogism will show how the noble consciousness will (d)evolve into the
base consciousness that young Rameau exemplified, and that the latter is
the <em>truth</em> of this stage of spirit’s development.</p>

<p>We begin when the noble consciousness acts on its judgment. In their
satisfied agreement with society, the noble individual devotes
themselves to ‘the heroism of <em>service</em>’: they devote their lives
to state power, to the public good.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> In doing so, they
establish the second estate of the Ancien Régime – the
<strong>nobility</strong> – and bestow actual <em>existence</em> onto
state power. Through the renunciation of their self-interest, the noble
earns respect; through the devotion of their existence to state power,
they transform state power from an abstract goal into an actualised
institution (the law, the rule of the land, etc.). However, this
institution is not yet truly <em>embodied</em>; it has no ‘particular
will’ but is only as ‘essential’ will, a custom without a self-directed
executive (like a King) to interpret this custom. Hegel refers to the
nobles as ‘vassals’, who value themselves only insofar as they have the
‘honour’ of contributing to the upkeep of state power. Nonetheless, for
as long as state power is not embodied in a self-conscious, particular
actuality, the ‘counsel’ offered by the vassal is of little use; the
‘general good’ is all that has power.<a href="#fn38"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>In this undeveloped shape, Hegel explains, state power ‘is indecisive
about the different opinions about the common good.’ It is not yet
<em>government</em>. There may be a monarch, to be sure, but the monarch
has no being-for-itself on which to discriminate between the
contradictory directions it might receive in the form of counsel. The
counselling vassals themselves, meanwhile, renounce themselves (that is,
sacrifice themselves to state power) only in a qualified sense. If their
counsel opposes the ‘general good’ – however indistinct the latter might
be – their life will be on the line. Having to censor themselves in the
face of the danger of death, ‘the counselor in fact reserves for himself
his own opinion and his particular individual will in the face of
state-authority.’<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Consequently, it turns out that the
noble consciousness is not quite as deferential as it once thought; the
vassal ‘is always within a stone’s throw of rebellion’, harbouring a
latent contempt for the inequality between their being-for-itself and
the universality of state power. Base consciousness is the truth of
noble consciousness.</p>
<p>If it is to retain its being-for-itself, and avoid either dying or
becoming a lifeless servant to state power, the counselor must somehow
sacrifice themselves completely, ‘as it does in death’, but without
dying.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> The only way it can do this is by
<em>relinquishing its being-for-itself</em>, and it can only do that
insofar as state power is also a self. How can this be done? How am I
able to completely give myself over to something (or, indeed,
some<em>one</em>) without dying? In Hyppolite’s words, the task is ‘to
find an exteriority of the I such that that exteriority still remains
I.’<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> Hegel finds such an exteriority in
<strong>language</strong>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We have already encountered the theme of language in the
<em>Phenomenology</em>. In the first chapter of the book, it is in
language that ‘we immediately refute what we mean to say’; in the fifth
chapter, the subject who speaks ‘abandons [their inwardness] to their
other.’<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> Language is thus understood in
terms of loss; through language our interiority is abandoned, we lose
hold of our intention. In other words, to speak is to surrender without
dying: this is why the noble counsellor must turn to language</p>
<p>At this point, Hegel develops his philosophy of language in
reflections which take the <em>form</em> of language for their
<em>content</em>. The counsellor speaks of themselves – they say ‘I’.
Only in language does the ‘I’ properly come into existence; it
distinguishes itself from ‘you’ and expresses my existence <em>for
others</em>. Before the act of language, Hegel claims, the self merely
‘reflects itself into itself’, taking on only ‘an incomplete existence,
a soulless existence’.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> This distinguishing is not
something stable, however. In being spoken – in being ‘<em>brought to a
hearing</em>’ – the ‘I’ loses any sense of private particularity, in the
same manner as the ‘now’ and ‘here’ of sensuous certainty did, and thus
enters the sphere of the <em>universal</em>.<a href="#fn44"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>
The sound of speech and the sight of writing (i.e., the
<em>particularities</em> of language) might be fleeting, but the
meaning, the <em>universality</em> of language, persists just so long as
it is heard or read.</p>
<p>Language thus starts to actualise the ‘I that is we’, to materialise
the spirit that is implicit within culture. (Hegel seems to have
recognised a close link between language and spirit even before writing
the <em>Phenomenology</em>; in an 1805 letter to Johann Heinrich Voss,
who translated the <em>Odyssey</em> into German, Hegel wrote that just
as Luther had done for the Bible, his endeavour was ‘to teach philosophy
to speak German.’<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>) Between the two extremes of
culture – the individual and social substance (here, the noble
consciousness and state power) – language serves as the mediating middle
through which ’<em>spiritual substance</em> enters into existence.<a
href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>However, this spirit is still only subjective and is thus
undeveloped. Of the two extremes that are united in language, one of
them (consciousness, the counsellor) follows state power out of
<em>honour</em> but not true <em>obligation</em>, and this is because
the other extreme (state power, the monarch) currently takes form only
as the ‘common good’ and not as an actual ‘<em>will</em>’.<a
href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> The exercises of language will
attempt to overcome this imperfection. We will see the crucial function
of language, by which the individual alienates themselves and becomes
universal and by which state power gains selfhood, take two different
shapes in its development: one of absolutist flattery, the other of
dogmatist ‘laceration’.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>To start with, noble consciousness gives rise to a
state-power-with-selfhood (or, a <em>willing</em> monarch) through
<strong>flattery</strong>, the speaking successor to the silent ‘heroism
of service’. Flattery endows the monarch with their name and all its
authoritative connotation; it elevates the monarch to a ‘pure individual
singular, no longer only in his own consciousness but in the
consciousness of all.’<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> It is generally accepted that here
Hegel is thinking of Louis XIV, the absolute monarch. Around the king,
the rest of the nobility sit and serve as his ‘ornaments’, Hegel writes,
and the purpose is to reproduce his authority through flattery.</p>
<p>One way of understanding this process is that the flattering language
of the nobility serves as <em>recognition</em> of the monarch’s right to
rule. Recognition, for Hegel, is the phenomenon through which the Other,
who might ordinarily be an <em>obstacle</em> to my acting, actually
<em>opens up</em> my freedom to act.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> This is why flattery
does not just <em>please</em> the monarchy, but in fact ‘gives it a
self-conscious existence’ with the capacity for ‘willing and
deciding’.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> This flattery is an illustration of
the performativity of language.</p>
<p>The nobles also benefit from this relationship; in thanks for their
flattery, the monarch delegates power of the state back to them. The
king is the ‘self’ of state- power – its will and direction – and his
nobles are its ‘essence’, through which his will is actualised. Through
this delegation, however, the monarchy begins to undermine itself:
state-power, despite having become spirit, has become ‘an essence whose
spirit consists in being sacrificed and relinquished’.<a href="#fn52"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>
Power is handed out generously as the gift of privilege and, as such,
becomes … wealth. The monarch unwittingly transforms themselves into a
mere distributor of wealth, a servant to the now-prosperous nobility.
‘All that remains to it of <em>universally</em> recognized and
non-mediated self-sufficiency is the empty name’: the king might as well
exist only as a portrait on a bank note. The nobles consequently see
little equality between themselves and the monarch. And in their
scrambling for wealth, their flattery has become totally inauthentic; it
is nothing more than a way for them to receive extra riches. They become
like Regan and Goneril in <em>King Lear</em>, and in them the difference
between noble and base consciousness has totally dissolved.</p>
<p>The social world is now one of ‘clients’ and ‘benefactors’. A
‘client’ – an individual who devotes their life to accruing wealth –
sees their selfhood placed ‘under the authority of an alien will’, Hegel
explains.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> What he means by this is that, now
that wealth has become the central concern, the point around which a
life is oriented, it has become an end in itself. Individuals have thus
emptied out their selfhood <em>into</em> wealth, depending on it
completely (as an ‘alien will’). Self-consciousness takes wealth as its
object, but wealth is itself just the objectified, <em>alienated</em>
form of self-consciousness; as such, and just as with the end of
observing reason, self-consciousness has found itself manifest as a dead
thing.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> Upon acknowledging this
contradiction – between themselves as an independent subject for-itself
and as a dead thing – the individual ‘stands above’ it, ‘sublates the
self’s sublation’, and takes the form of ‘absolute elasticity’.<a
href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> This elastic subject accepts wealth
from their benefactors but dismisses their benefactors nonetheless,
looking with contempt and cynicism upon the social world.<a href="#fn56"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>As the rich benefactors and patrons of society arrogantly think that
‘with a meal’ they can purchase the selfhood of their clients, they
overlook the ‘inner indignation’ and ‘pure disruption’ that this
selfhood represents.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> There is nothing stable about the
elastic individual; they are a cynical nihilist, willing to change their
mindset in an instant, devoted only to a complete lack of devotion at
all. Hegel dramatically describes how the aristocratic benefactor stands
before this nihilism, underestimating it completely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It stands immediately before this most inward abyss, before this
bottomless depth, in which all foothold and substance have vanished, and
in these depths it sees nothing but a common thing, a play of its
vagaries, an accident of its arbitrary choices. Its spirit is just
essenceless opinion, a superficiality forsaken by spirit.<a href="#fn58"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps in this notion of ‘essenceless opinion’ there is a
foreshadowing of Kierkegaard and Heidegger, two bourgeois critics of
society, with their notions of ‘chatter’ and ‘idle talk’. Kierkegaard
criticises the chatter which talks about ‘anything and everything’
without any reflection or <em>inwardness</em>;<a href="#fn59"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>
Heidegger describes (but does not <em>disparage</em>, he claims) the
idle talk which ‘gossips’ with an air of authority but loses a ‘primary
relationship’ to its subject matter.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> However, the
nihilistic critic that Hegel is describing is a lot less serious and
reverent than Kierkegaard and Hegel; this critic is the young Rameau
whose mocking language ‘is the perfected language of this entire world
of culture’.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Rameau is practically undefeatable in conversation: by the time
someone has refuted a point of his, he has already moved on to something
else. He ‘repudiates his own abjectness’, Hegel writes; his identity is
‘disruption’, the total lack of consistent identity. As a form of
self-consciousness, Rameau (and any ‘client’ consciousness that he
represents) still asserts himself and his identity, but ‘this identical
judgment is at the same time the infinite judgment’: that is, his
identity is defined by a negation.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a> Keeping in mind that
infinite judgments always have the structure ‘X is not Y’, we should
understand Rameau’s identity to be defined as something like: ‘I am not
cultured’. Crucially, it is in this disavowal that Rameau <em>most
exemplifies</em> culture: the disruption of his nihilism and relativism
are culture in its absolute truth, in the chaotic and constant
dissolution of all of its elements into one another.</p>
<p>The ‘turmoil-ridden <em>judging</em>’ is the final stage in culture’s
development. The individual who has undergone the greatest
<em>Bildung</em>, the greatest cultural formation, is what Hegel calls
‘the disruptive consciousness’, and it is they who most truthfully
represent the feudal world of culture.<a href="#fn63"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>
In their ‘candor’ (that is, their self-awareness in having no
consistency) this cultured individual finds ‘a strain of
reconciliation’; they are ‘<em>denatured</em>’ by a ‘strain of the
ridiculous’ – Hegel is quoting Diderot here – and thereby get closer to
a truly <em>spiritual</em> existence.<a href="#fn64"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Because the disruptive consciousness represents the truth of culture
as a whole, their opponent – the <em>philosophe</em>, or what Hegel
calls ‘simple consciousness’ – is left lost for words. If they can
muster up anything beyond mere ‘monosyllables’, they will still be
representing only a particular moment of culture and will therefore be
saying nothing that the disruptive nihilist does not already know.<a
href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> If they cite <em>examples</em> of
‘the excellent’ – stories that are supposed to convince us that, really,
culture <em>does</em> have a noble element, and wealth and flattery
aren’t just hypocritical emptinesses – the nihilist can simply respond
by pointing out that these are only individual cases; they don’t hold up
to the holism of the disruptive view of society. ‘To present the
existence of the good and the noble as a single anecdote, whether
fictitious or true,’ Hegel writes, ‘is the most caustic thing that can
be said about it.’<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"
