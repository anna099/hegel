<h2 id="spirit">Spirit</h2>
<h3 id="alienated-spirit-culture">Alienated Spirit: Culture</h3>
<p>In a beautiful passage of his early work <em>The Spirit of
Christianity and its Fate</em>, Hegel gives an analysis of the Last
Supper.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> He writes of the ‘bond of
friendship’ and the acts that actualise friendship and love, and he
takes the sharing of Jesus’s cup to be a paradigmatic case of such acts.
But the passage is most interesting because it is one of Hegel’s
earliest examinations of <em>spirit</em>. ‘Objectively considered, then,
the bread is just bread, the wine just wine; yet both are something
more’: in the Last Supper, as Hegel understands it, we see things take
on a significance beyond their natural existence – that is, we see
<em>spirit</em> arise from out of nature. We do not have to be religious
to understand his point, since we can interpret it as an allegory: in
the bread and wine that Jesus offers, Hegel writes, the <em>spirit</em>
of Jesus ‘has become a present object, a reality, for external feeling’.
Then, in the consumption of the bread and wine, the spirit that has
become objective ‘reverts once more to its nature, becomes subjective
again in the eating’. Hegel gives another analogy, this time
non-religious: ‘This return may perhaps in this respect be compared with
the thought which in the written word becomes a thing and which
recaptures its subjectivity out of an object, out of something lifeless,
when we read.’ Both the Last Supper and the act of reading have the same
structure: something internal (Jesus’s spiritual presence, or the
thought of a writer) is <em>externalised</em>, and then (through the
eating or reading carried out by the Other) is <em>re-internalised</em>
and takes on a new significance.</p>
<p>This motif – of going outside of oneself and then returning – is
precisely how spirit comes on the scene. Now, in the
<em>Phenomenology</em>’s sixth chapter, we are concerned with spirit in
a more sophisticated sense: spirit is not here restricted to a small
group of disciples or to a writer and reader, but is something
permeating societies in general. The harmonious society of Greece was
the site of spirit in its first, immediate existence. Now, before we
reach the existence of spirit as self-conscious in and for itself, we
must work through its second moment, its externalisation out of itself:
that is, its <em>alienation</em>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>What then does it mean to be alienated? The answer is that
self-consciousness and its ethical substance – that is, the individual
and society – are in a conscious ‘unity’ but nonetheless experience
‘alienation’ from each other. In other word, the individual recognises
themselves as part of a society, as a constituent of their social
environment, but nonetheless does not feel at home in this society. This
stage of culture, therefore, runs parallel to unhappy consciousness,
wherein self-consciousness felt alienated from a ‘God’ who, unbeknownst
to them, was within them from the start. By alienating the individuals
that constitute it, the ‘substance’ of the social world ‘is itself its
own self-relinquishing’: it splits itself into two, externalising what
is internal to it.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This is precisely how ethical
substance, <em>as spirit</em>, moves into its second stage: in
undergoing this externalisation, alienation, or self-relinquishing, it
ascends from out of its immediate existence (which we saw in Greece) and
awaits the return into itself through which it will reach its truth.</p>
<p>Because they are alienated, whenever the individual of culture enters
‘the actual world’, they always ‘pass over again back into actual
self-consciousness’.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> In other words, their experience of
the social world is so unwelcoming and unfamiliar that they plunge back
into thought, constructing their own world – the opposite of the present
moment, or the ‘<em>other-worldly beyond</em>’.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
This is yet another similarity with unhappy consciousness. Because of
these similarities, and because of what preceded this chapter, we might
be inclined to think that here Hegel is thinking of Christianity as it
came to flourish following the conversion of Constantine. However, we
also know that Hegel took the alienation described in this chapter as a
defining characteristic of <em>modernity</em>, and his explicit
references (to the Enlightenment, the French Revolution and the Terror)
suggest that he is thinking of the modern era. Robert Solomon argues
that the <em>Phenomenology</em> simply jumps from Rome to modernity – a
‘glaring omission’ that proves to us that Hegel is not attempting a
literal history.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> On the other hand, Terry Pinkard
argues that Hegel, unlike his contemporaries, did not think of the
ancient era as separated from modernity by the so-called ‘Middle
Ages’.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> On this view, for Hegel as for
Nietzsche, the first signs of modernity are present in the birth of the
Christian conception of selfhood. So, while Solomon is partially right –
the <em>Phenomenology</em> is not a literal history, as I have explained
above – he is wrong to find an ‘omission’ in the book. The present
chapter takes us on a route from medieval Christianity through the
Enlightenment and up to the climax of the French Revolution, in a manner
that, admittedly, may be more logical than chronological.</p>
<p>To close the introductory section of this chapter, Hegel gives a
summary of the entire section in one long paragraph. Spirit has become
divided, opposed within itself, and gives way to ‘a doubled world’.<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Although the world is present before
us, its <em>essence</em> is understood as belonging to some ‘beyond’ –
everything thus ‘receives actuality from an other’. Individuals in
self-alienated spirit take the <em>truth</em> of the world to be
separated from the world they inhabit, postponed to a realm beyond life.
The premodern world was divided (for instance, into human and divine
law), but its inhabitants didn’t acknowledge this divide because they
immediately identified with it, on the basis of ‘nature’. In alienated
modernity, people actually <em>acknowledge</em> these dualisms and
attempt to conceptually comprehend them in various ways. Living
according to these dichotomies they have posited, modern individuals
adopt <strong>cultural formation</strong> (<em>Bildung</em>) as their
form of life and attempt to transform their selfhood (as the characters
in <em>Bildungsromane</em> do) in order to align themselves with the
‘good’ side of a dichotomy – or, as Taylor puts it, ‘to close the gap
between themselves and social reality.’<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Of
course, all such attempts prevent a real unity with the world and keep
the individuals from being at home in their world.</p>
<p>There are two systems of dichotomies that self-consciousness posits
following its entry into the stage of cultural formation: firstly, a
religious worldview wherein the world is taken as untrue in contrast to
a harmonious beyond, posited by <strong>faith</strong>, ‘which has no
actual present’.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Secondly, when this faith is
interpreted in the secular terms of the <strong>Enlightenment</strong>,
the ‘housekeeping of faith’ is brought into ‘disarray’ as the present
world is comprehended coldly in terms of <em>utility</em>, and the
beyond is taken to be utterly unknowable ‘<em>absolute essence</em>’.
Though the Enlightenment robs the world of any substantiality, promoting
only the equally empty worldviews of deism or materialism, the priority
it affords to the actual individual paves the way for the
<strong>absolute freedom</strong> exhibited in the French Revolution,
through which spirit ‘abandons this land of cultural formation and
crosses over into another land, into the land of <em>moral
consciousness</em>.’</p>
<h4 id="cultural-formation-and-its-realm-of-actuality">Cultural
Formation and its Realm of Actuality</h4>
<p>The world of culture, as Hegel sees it, is one wherein individuals
are equal. This equality is not established through legal status or
legal status or through mutual recognition, but through each
individual’s equal alienated conformity to the universal. Everyone
relinquishes their individuality – gives up their desires,
personalities, and so on – in order to bring the world to its actuality
and achieve oneness with the beyond. Seeing the world as something
alien, cultural individuals aim not to belong in the world but to ‘take
possession’ of it, precisely by mastering nature (especially their own
natural existence) according to God’s will.<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
<em>Bildung</em> is the name for this mastery.</p>
<p>By carrying out their life in this way, the individual comes to
realise that their ‘actuality still solely consists in their sublation
of [their] natural self.’<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> We should therefore
understand ‘culture’ as that element of life which Rousseau was so upset
about, through which ‘everything degenerates in the hands of man.’<a
href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Unlike Rousseau, the individual at
this stage of the <em>Phenomenology</em> venerates culture and is
dismissive of nature: they regard individuality as ‘falsely posited as
lying in the <em>particularity</em> of nature’; individuality is rather
found in alienated <em>Bildung</em>, in the grand world of culture that
looks with contempt upon the lowly world of our natural existence. The
cultured individual urges us to forget the ‘powerless’ and ‘non-actual’
contingencies of nature; insofar as we are engaged in cultural
formation, they claim, we are all equal before God. (This is the
equality of ‘conformity’ that I introduced above.)</p>
<p>Without being aware of it, the individual still has a relation to the
social world that it feels alienated from. In the process of cultural
formation, ‘the individual empties itself of its own self’ – that is,
renunciates its pre-cultural characteristics – and <em>gives itself
over</em> to culture (or, more precisely, to the institutions,
communities, and practices that embody culture).<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
‘Hence,’ Hegel writes, ‘its cultural formation and its own actuality are
the actualization of substance itself.’ Although the individual takes
‘culture’ to be an alien essence, instituted by God’s will, it is in
fact <em>constituted</em> by the individual’s <em>Bildung</em>.</p>
<p>What shape does this constitution take? The individual, which still
lives along the dualistic lines of unhappy consciousness, divides social
substance up into opposing parts which exist through their opposition to
one another. The ‘thinking’ of cultured individuals, Hegel explains,
establishes the <em>difference</em> between these two parts by
identifying one as ‘good’ and the other as ‘bad’.<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
The individual thus acts like the ‘soul’ of their society, attempting to
understand its structure and development by fixing it into rigid
categories. In this sense, the individual actually understands
themselves <em>not</em> as an individual first and foremost, but instead
as a living expression or articulation of the culture they live in –
since, for now, they do not realise that they themselves constitute this
culture. We will see the downfall of this form of individuality when
each ‘moment’ it posits of society – ‘good’, ‘bad’, or whatever else –
passes into its opposite and the entire categorisation is
undermined.</p>
<p>The first form of categorisation Hegel presents us with breaks
society up into various estates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as nature explicates itself into universal elements, under which
fall [air, water, fire, and earth] … In this way, the inner
<em>essence</em>, or the simple spirit of self-consciousness actuality,
explicates itself into just those kinds of universal, though spiritual,
social estates.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a strange claim. The parallel drawn between a natural
division (the four elements) and a social division (the estates) might
remind us of the Greek system of human and divine law being based on
‘natural’ gender distinctions, and this resonance is prboably
intentional. The difference here, however, is that in this passage Hegel
is presumably only giving an <em>analogy</em>, rather than a causal
explanation. Nonetheless, the characteristics that he attributes to each
of the four elements are comparable with the characteristics of the
social estates he describes.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Air</em>: the element which <em>endures</em> and in which
‘everything individual is sublimated’ – corresponding to the social
essence as it is purely in itself and equal to itself, and the
‘<strong>state power</strong>’ which renders individuals as uniform.<a
href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Water</em>: the element which stands for ‘the real possibility
of difference’, which in its form is ‘ever sacrificed’ rather than
enduring – corrseponding to the social essence as it is <em>for</em>
itself, unequal to itself and self-sacrificing, manifest in
‘<strong>wealth</strong>’, the social form of free consumption and
self-interest.</li>
<li><em>Fire</em>: the element of ‘individuality existing on its own
account’, ‘a self-relating negativity’ – corresponding to the social
essence existing in <em>and</em> for itself, giving way to the rise of
real subjectivity and self-consciousness. The ‘force of fire’ in a
society is thus its latent potential for a revolution which will come
about only when its estates (‘state power’ and ‘wealth’) are recognised
as dissolving into one another.</li>
<li><em>Earth</em>: the element distinct from all the others which is
‘indeterminate’ but nonetheless is ‘the totality which holds together’
the other elements – corresponding to social essence <em>as such</em>,
the ground ‘from which [social phenomena] start and to which they
return.’</li>
