<h2 id="spirit">Spirit</h2>
<h3 id="alienated-spirit-culture">Alienated Spirit: Culture</h3>
<p>In a beautiful passage of his early work <em>The Spirit of
Christianity and its Fate</em>, Hegel gives an analysis of the Last
Supper.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> He writes of the ‘bond of
friendship’ and the acts that actualise friendship and love, and he
takes the sharing of Jesus’s cup to be a paradigmatic case of such acts.
But the passage is most interesting because it is one of Hegel’s
earliest examinations of <em>spirit</em>. ‘Objectively considered, then,
the bread is just bread, the wine just wine; yet both are something
more’: in the Last Supper, as Hegel understands it, we see things take
on a significance beyond their natural existence – that is, we see
<em>spirit</em> arise from out of nature. We do not have to be religious
to understand his point, since we can interpret it as an allegory: in
the bread and wine that Jesus offers, Hegel writes, the <em>spirit</em>
of Jesus ‘has become a present object, a reality, for external feeling’.
Then, in the consumption of the bread and wine, the spirit that has
become objective ‘reverts once more to its nature, becomes subjective
again in the eating’. Hegel gives another analogy, this time
non-religious: ‘This return may perhaps in this respect be compared with
the thought which in the written word becomes a thing and which
recaptures its subjectivity out of an object, out of something lifeless,
when we read.’ Both the Last Supper and the act of reading have the same
structure: something internal (Jesus’s spiritual presence, or the
thought of a writer) is <em>externalised</em>, and then (through the
eating or reading carried out by the Other) is <em>re-internalised</em>
and takes on a new significance.</p>
<p>This motif – of going outside of oneself and then returning – is
precisely how spirit comes on the scene. Now, in the
<em>Phenomenology</em>’s sixth chapter, we are concerned with spirit in
a more sophisticated sense: spirit is not here restricted to a small
group of disciples or to a writer and reader, but is something
permeating societies in general. The harmonious society of Greece was
the site of spirit in its first, immediate existence. Now, before we
reach the existence of spirit as self-conscious in and for itself, we
must work through its second moment, its externalisation out of itself:
that is, its <em>alienation</em>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>What then does it mean to be alienated? The answer is that
self-consciousness and its ethical substance – that is, the individual
and society – are in a conscious ‘unity’ but nonetheless experience
‘alienation’ from each other. In other word, the individual recognises
themselves as part of a society, as a constituent of their social
environment, but nonetheless does not feel at home in this society. This
stage of culture, therefore, runs parallel to unhappy consciousness,
wherein self-consciousness felt alienated from a ‘God’ who, unbeknownst
to them, was within them from the start. By alienating the individuals
that constitute it, the ‘substance’ of the social world ‘is itself its
own self-relinquishing’: it splits itself into two, externalising what
is internal to it.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This is precisely how ethical
substance, <em>as spirit</em>, moves into its second stage: in
undergoing this externalisation, alienation, or self-relinquishing, it
ascends from out of its immediate existence (which we saw in Greece) and
awaits the return into itself through which it will reach its truth.</p>
<p>Because they are alienated, whenever the individual of culture enters
‘the actual world’, they always ‘pass over again back into actual
self-consciousness’.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> In other words, their experience of
the social world is so unwelcoming and unfamiliar that they plunge back
into thought, constructing their own world – the opposite of the present
moment, or the ‘<em>other-worldly beyond</em>’.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
This is yet another similarity with unhappy consciousness. Because of
these similarities, and because of what preceded this chapter, we might
be inclined to think that here Hegel is thinking of Christianity as it
came to flourish following the conversion of Constantine. However, we
also know that Hegel took the alienation described in this chapter as a
defining characteristic of <em>modernity</em>, and his explicit
references (to the Enlightenment, the French Revolution and the Terror)
suggest that he is thinking of the modern era. Robert Solomon argues
that the <em>Phenomenology</em> simply jumps from Rome to modernity – a
‘glaring omission’ that proves to us that Hegel is not attempting a
literal history.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> On the other hand, Terry Pinkard
argues that Hegel, unlike his contemporaries, did not think of the
ancient era as separated from modernity by the so-called ‘Middle
Ages’.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> On this view, for Hegel as for
Nietzsche, the first signs of modernity are present in the birth of the
Christian conception of selfhood. So, while Solomon is partially right –
the <em>Phenomenology</em> is not a literal history, as I have explained
above – he is wrong to find an ‘omission’ in the book. The present
chapter takes us on a route from medieval Christianity through the
Enlightenment and up to the climax of the French Revolution, in a manner
that, admittedly, may be more logical than chronological.</p>
<p>To close the introductory section of this chapter, Hegel gives a
summary of the entire section in one long paragraph. Spirit has become
divided, opposed within itself, and gives way to ‘a doubled world’.<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Although the world is present before
us, its <em>essence</em> is understood as belonging to some ‘beyond’ –
everything thus ‘receives actuality from an other’. Individuals in
self-alienated spirit take the <em>truth</em> of the world to be
separated from the world they inhabit, postponed to a realm beyond life.
The premodern world was divided (for instance, into human and divine
law), but its inhabitants didn’t acknowledge this divide because they
immediately identified with it, on the basis of ‘nature’. In alienated
modernity, people actually <em>acknowledge</em> these dualisms and
attempt to conceptually comprehend them in various ways. Living
according to these dichotomies they have posited, modern individuals
adopt <strong>cultural formation</strong> (<em>Bildung</em>) as their
form of life and attempt to transform their selfhood (as the characters
in <em>Bildungsromane</em> do) in order to align themselves with the
‘good’ side of a dichotomy – or, as Taylor puts it, ‘to close the gap
between themselves and social reality.’<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Of
course, all such attempts prevent a real unity with the world and keep
the individuals from being at home in their world.</p>
<p>There are two systems of dichotomies that self-consciousness posits
following its entry into the stage of cultural formation: firstly, a
religious worldview wherein the world is taken as untrue in contrast to
a harmonious beyond, posited by <strong>faith</strong>, ‘which has no
actual present’.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Secondly, when this faith is
interpreted in the secular terms of the <strong>Enlightenment</strong>,
the ‘housekeeping of faith’ is brought into ‘disarray’ as the present
world is comprehended coldly in terms of <em>utility</em>, and the
beyond is taken to be utterly unknowable ‘<em>absolute essence</em>’.
Though the Enlightenment robs the world of any substantiality, promoting
only the equally empty worldviews of deism or materialism, the priority
it affords to the actual individual paves the way for the
<strong>absolute freedom</strong> exhibited in the French Revolution,
through which spirit ‘abandons this land of cultural formation and
crosses over into another land, into the land of <em>moral
consciousness</em>.’</p>
