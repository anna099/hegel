            <h3 id="s-c">Sensuous certainty</h3>
            <p>'Sensuous certainty' is the name for the intial kind of knowing an object; specifically, the kind of knowing for which the object is <em>immediate</em>. Taking any spatiotemporal thing as its object, sensuous-certainty has no limit as regards its 'wealth', since it can take its object from anywhere in the infinite boundaries of space and time, and can furthermore divide any such object into more distinct objects. The object apprehended by sensuous-certainty is not only immediate but <em>complete</em>, since nothing is taken away or added to it; instead, it is laid before consciousness as <em>this</em> which <em>is</em>. In other words, it is apprehended in its pure being. The apprehending consciousness, as well, is also held in certainty, by itself, as another <em>this</em> which <em>is</em>; consequently, any particular experience of sensuous-certainty takes the form: '<em>this</em> I, a singular individual consciousness, knows <em>this</em> object, a singular individual thing'. In the world of sensuous-certainty, there is no causality, no unification, no essences or properties, no relations: there is merely the being of manifold particulars. This is sensuous-certainty's claim to absolute knowledge.</p>
            <p>Clearly, then, while the strength of sensuous-certainty is in the <em>completeness</em> of its object, its weakness is in the <em>abstractness</em> of its truth, since it expresses nothing but the pure being of the object and of the consciousness apprehending it. In fact, it is this abstractness and simplicity which reveals to us the dialectic within sensuous-certainty. As a singular thing, the object of sensuous-certainty is a <em>this</em> which is <em>here</em> and <em>now</em>. Each of these three terms name the radical particularity of the thing. I have sensuous-certainty <em>now</em> ... and yet, as soon as I have named this 'now', it is gone: the moment has passed. Likewise, if I face the thing, I can say that it is <em>here</em>, but if I turn around, then while I can still refer to a 'here', it is no longer 'here' that the thing in question is found. In both of these cases, the <em>Here</em> and <em>Now</em> persevere, while the thing of which I had sensuous-certainty disappears. That which we call 'now' is indifferent to whether it is 5:00 PM, 3:00 AM, or any other time. Through every moment, the <em>Now</em> endures; it is <em>mediated</em> through the moment. The moment is a particular expression of the <em>Now</em>, and the location of sensuous-certainty is an expression of the <em>Here</em>. <em>Now</em> and <em>Here</em> are thus <em>universals</em>. 'Now' means: <em>not</em> 5:00 PM, <em>not</em> 3:00 AM, <em>not</em> any unique particular moment; as Hegel explains, 'As little as night and dary are its being, it is just as much night and day. ... Such a simple is through negation; it is neither this nor that, it is both a <em>not-this</em> and is just as indifferent to being this or that, and such a simple is what we call a <em>universal</em>.'<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
            <p>As such, the truth of sensuous-certainty is the opposite of its original truth. At the start, its truth was in its consistent particularity; it is now in its emergent universality. Sensuous-certainty has <em>refuted itself</em>, and language has shown this: 'In language, we immediately refute what we <em>mean to say</em>, and since the universal is the truth of sensuous-certainty, and language only expresses this truth, it is, in that way, not possible at all that we could say what we <em>mean</em> about sensuous being.'<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> By this, Hegel shows that, just as language necessarily deals only with universals (in 'this tree', both the word 'this' and 'tree' are mediated universals, as explained above), so too does sensuous-certainty itself give rise to universals when it 'means' to refer only to particulars. In the very moment, I might 'know what I mean' when I refer to <em>this tree</em>; nonetheless, as soon as the words ('this tree') are <em>written down</em>, my subjectivity is removed from them, and universality takes its place. Consequently we find that what is persistent in sensuous-certainty's experience of the <em>This</em> is not the <em>object</em>, but the subject <em>for whom the object is a 'This', here and now</em>. 'Now' is midnight, or noon, or whenever else, because <em>I</em> name it so; 'now' is always <em>my</em> 'now'.</p>
            <p>Who is this 'I'? As the subject that names an object to be a particular This, at a particular <em>here and now</em>, it must too be a particular. There is an 'I' for each moment; an 'I' for each This that is apprehended. However, this radical particularity can only be realised by comparison - contradistinction - with other radical particulars. From whose standpoint is this comparison carried out? It is precisely through the <em>universal</em> 'I' that it is done. In all experience of sensuous-certainty, 'what does not disappear is <em>I as universal</em>, whose [universal] seeing is neither a seeing of the tree nor of this house.'<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> As such, the truth of sensuous-certainty has shifted away from the object and on to the subject. Nonetheless, this (the I) only emerges as a consequence of a <em>reflex</em>, after sensuous-certainty is forced to turn away from the object that it failed to grasp immediately. Consequently, this minimal subject is not a 'self' but something much simpler; it is merely <em>the being that identifies another being as a 'This'</em>. The 'self' as we know it will not emerge until self-consciousness comes on the scene.</p>
            <p>At this point, sensuous-certainty has gone through two dialectical moments that transformed its original position. At first, it made its claim to absolute knowledge by (ostensibly) grasping its object <em>immediately</em>, as a particular 'this', in a particular time and space. This immediate particularity was negated, however, as the very concepts - 'This', 'Here', and 'Now' - that were supposed to be the guarantors of radical particularity turned out to be universals, defined through negation (the <em>true</em> 'now' is always <em>not</em>-now; it can <em>never</em> be named). Thus, following the first dialectical moment, the <em>object</em> (the universal This) became the essential character of sensuous-certainty. Following this, however, it is the universal <em>subject</em> that becomes essential, since there must be an agent of comparison to realise the negativity that constitutes the universal object. That is to say, there must be a subject who - <em>through comparison</em> - realises the true Now as a universal 'not-now'.</p>
