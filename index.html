            <h3 id="s-c">Sensuous certainty</h3>
            <p>‘Sensuous certainty’ is the name for the intial kind of knowing an object; specifically, the kind of knowing for which the object is <em>immediate</em>. Taking any spatiotemporal thing as its object, sensuous-certainty has no limit as regards its ‘wealth’, since it can take its object from anywhere in the infinite boundaries of space and time, and can furthermore divide any such object into more distinct objects. The object apprehended by sensuous-certainty is not only immediate but <em>complete</em>, since nothing is taken away or added to it; instead, it is laid before consciousness as <em>this</em> which <em>is</em>. In other words, it is apprehended in its pure being. The apprehending consciousness, as well, is also held in certainty, by itself, as another <em>this</em> which <em>is</em>; consequently, any particular experience of sensuous-certainty takes the form: ‘<em>this</em> I, a singular individual consciousness, knows <em>this</em> object, a singular individual thing’. In the world of sensuous-certainty, there is no causality, no unification, no essences or properties, no relations: there is merely the being of manifold particulars. This is sensuous-certainty’s claim to absolute knowledge.</p>
            <p>Clearly, then, while the strength of sensuous-certainty is in the <em>completeness</em> of its object, its weakness is in the <em>abstractness</em> of its truth, since it expresses nothing but the pure being of the object and of the consciousness apprehending it. In fact, it is this abstractness and simplicity which reveals to us the dialectic within sensuous-certainty. As a singular thing, the object of sensuous-certainty is a <em>this</em> which is <em>here</em> and <em>now</em>. Each of these three terms name the radical particularity of the thing. I have sensuous-certainty <em>now</em> … and yet, as soon as I have named this ‘now’, it is gone: the moment has passed. Likewise, if I face the thing, I can say that it is <em>here</em>, but if I turn around, then while I can still refer to a ‘here’, it is no longer ‘here’ that the thing in question is found. In both of these cases, the <em>Here</em> and <em>Now</em> persevere, while the thing of which I had sensuous-certainty disappears. That which we call ‘now’ is indifferent to whether it is 5:00 PM, 3:00 AM, or any other time. Through every moment, the <em>Now</em> endures; it is <em>mediated</em> through the moment. The moment is a particular expression of the <em>Now</em>, and the location of sensuous-certainty is an expression of the <em>Here</em>. <em>Now</em> and <em>Here</em> are thus <em>universals</em>. ‘Now’ means: <em>not</em> 5:00 PM, <em>not</em> 3:00 AM, <em>not</em> any unique particular moment; as Hegel explains, ‘As little as night and dary are its being, it is just as much night and day. … Such a simple is through negation; it is neither this nor that, it is both a <em>not-this</em> and is just as indifferent to being this or that, and such a simple is what we call a <em>universal</em>’.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
