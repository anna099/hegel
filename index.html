<h3 id="what">What is the <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em>?</h3>
<p>In October 1806, as Napoleon entered Jena, Hegel finished his first book: <em>The Phenomenology of Spirit</em>. The book is intended to serve as an introduction to Hegel’s system of science, showing the ‘coming to be of knowledge’, as <strong>spirit</strong> [<em>Geist</em>] makes its way through various stages towards the stage of scientific knowing, or, <em>absolute spirit</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The book is thus a <em>phenomenology</em> insofar as it analyses the phenomena (that is, the <em>appearances</em>) of consciousness’s various attempts at absolute knowledge. This is undoubtedly an ambitious project; and as such it is no surprise that the book is incredibly complex and difficult to understand, even for somebody familiar with modern German philosophy. The sheer difficulty in reading Hegel’s <em>Phenomenology</em> has led to a large quantity of incommensurable readings of the text: it has been interpreted as a metaphysical Bildungsroman, a systematic defence of orthodox Christianity, a revolutionary <em>critique</em> of Christianity, and as a text that is proto-existentialist, proto-communist, proto-fascist, or proto-nihilistic. The two social categories of twentieth century philosophical thought – ‘analytic’ and ‘Continental’ philosophy – both emerged from the British and Austro-German reception of Hegel’s work. Prior to the Second World War, Hegel scholarship was often dogmatic or idiosyncratic, with Alexandre Kojève’s famous reading<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, endorsed by Sartre and De Beauvoir, emphasising subjective relations of <em>desire</em> as the central element of Hegel’s thought, and Russell and Moore’s complete rejection of British Hegelian thought as needlessly obscure. In the 1940s and onwards, however, rigorous studies in German, French, and eventually English have put the <em>Phenomenology</em> beneath a brighter and clearer light. Though there is still a lot of disagreement over the interpretation of Hegel, we are now in a better place than ever to understand what the meaning and purpose of his <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> is.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why a System of Science?</h3>
<p>Part of what makes Hegel’s work so intimidating is its insistence on systematicity. The <em>Phenomenology</em> alone is an incredibly systematic work, making its way rigorously from the most basic form of consciousness to the sophistications of religion and politics. And yet the <em>Phenomenology</em> itself is only an <em>introduction</em> to Hegel’s larger system of science as a whole … where does this insistence on systematic philosophy come from? The answer is found in the context of German philosophy in which Hegel’s work came about, and helps us to understand the function of the <em>Phenomenology</em>.</p>
<h4 id="jacobi">Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi</h4>
<p>If Socrates was the gadfly of Ancient Athens, Jacobi was the gadfly of late nineteenth-century Germany. The ‘pantheism controversy’ that shook up German (and eventually, wider European) intellectual culture was initiated when Jacobi made provocative claims against Gotthold Lessing and the tradition of German (Leibnizian) rationalism that was predominant at the time. According to Jacobi, rationalism – which understood <em>reasons</em> as grounding explanations for facts – inevitably led to monistic, fatalist atheism of the controversial kind that Spinoza had been accused of. The principle of Leibnizian rationalism was the <em>Principle of Sufficient Reason</em>, which Jacobi equated with the idea that <em>ex nihilo nihil fit</em>. Consequently, the rationalist must accept that the reason for <em>x</em> also has a reason, which also has a reason, and so on. The notion of a <strong>first cause</strong> thus emerges to halt this infinite regress of reasons. Though we might suspect that God would be identified as the first cause, Jacobi’s reading of Spinoza led him to claim otherwise. For Spinoza, the first cause is <em>being itself</em>, or, the totality of <em>all that is</em>, because a first cause could be neither transcendental (and therefore conditioned by nothing, contravening the Principle of Sufficient Reason) nor rational (and therefore capable of representation, making it relational and therefore not self-standing). Thus, according to Jacobi’s reading of Spinoza, rationalism is necessarily atheistic. It is also fatalistic, because to affirm free will is to affirm the possibility of multiple first causes (i.e. willing agents), and nihilistic, since it denies the existence of entities altogether: for Spinoza, every ‘thing’ is merely a modification of the single substance (<em>being</em> or nature).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The German rationalist project was thereby called into question by Jacobi. If it was really the case that rationalism inevitably led to atheism, fatalism, and nihilism, then clearly some alternative was due. Jacobi’s solution was not to <em>refute</em> rationalism, since to do so would be to continue the rationalist paradigm of providing endless reasons for all knowledge. Instead, Jacobi redefined reason as a matter of ‘natural faith’ through which we <em>perceive</em> (but don’t necessarily <em>cognise</em>) the infinite.</p>
<h4 id="kant">Immanuel Kant</h4>
<p>Even more famously than Jacobi, Kant’s <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> dealt with the failure of rationalism’s monistic system (monistic because it unifies everything beneath one first cause). Aside from his influence from Hume (see <a href="https://anna099.github.io/kant/#gen-prob">here</a>), Kant’s work was also motivated by a tension between <strong>Newton’s</strong> system of natural science (in which everything had a sufficient cause, and there was no first cause or ‘causal God’) and <strong>Leibniz’s</strong> metaphysics which demanded that everything be intelligible (and thereby required the grounding of a first cause). The Kantian solution was a new kind of dualism in which the physical (Newtonian phenomena) and the metaphysical (Leibnizian intelligibility) operate at different levels of explanation. Thus, for Kant, the mind has separate faculties: the receptive <em>sensibility</em>, which intuits finitely intelligible (i.e. causal) information from the Newtonian physical world, and the spontaneous faculty of <em>reason</em>, which cognised about infinitely intelligible (i.e. Leibnizian, grounded) things in themselves – albeit only in a <em>formal</em> sense. Kant accordingly divides reality, giving the name ‘noumena’ to those things in themselves that we cannot sensibly intuit (that is, objects that belong only to the understanding), and ‘phenomena’ to all objects of <em>appearance</em>.</p>
<p>So, with the publication of his <em>Critique</em> in in 1781, Kant had come the closest to finally providing a <em>proper grounding</em> to knowledge, in contrast to the failure of the rationalist project. However, he had failed to heed Spinoza’s monistic demand that Jacobi would later understand; his system, insofar as it grounded the intelligible phenomenal in the <em>unintelligible</em> noumenal, <em>was not a complete system</em>; it was constitutively <em>dualistic</em> (with the dualisms of intuition and concept, phenomenon and noumenon, appearance and thing-in-itself, and so on, running throughout) and therefore failed to meet the monistic demand of real systematicity. Hegel’s particular formulation of this criticism accused Kant of <em>subjective</em> idealism, even in spite of Kant’s attempts to distance himself from Bishop Berkeley:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Objectivity of thought, in Kant’s sense, is again to a certain sense subjective. Thoughts, according to Kant, although universal and necessary categories, are <em>only our</em> thoughts – separated by an impassable gulf from the thing, as it exists apart from our knowledge.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jacobi also failed to meet the monistic demand – albeit less subtly – since he followed Hume in suggesting that we merely place <em>faith</em> in an unintelligible grounding of our knowledge. Thus the post-Kantian tradition of German Idealism, to which Hegel belongs, was born. Paul Franks says of the German Idealists – the most notable amongst them Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel – that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>they are all committed, in various ways, to the view that genuine justification can be achieved only within a system that meets two conditions: the <em>holistic condition</em> that every particular (object, fact, or judgment) be determined through its role within the whole and not through any intrinsic properties; and the <em>monistic condition</em> that the whole be grounded in an absolute principle that is immanent and not transcendent.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the project of German Idealism had to escape the nihilism that Jacobi had identified with monism: thus Hegel (and Fichte, Schelling, and so on) had to (1) overcome the Kantian dualisms that lacked an intelligible grounding, and (2) account for the emergence of individual, willing things within a monistic reality. This is the project for Hegel’s system.</p>
<h3 id="method">The Method of the Phenomenology</h3>
<p>If we read on from the quotation from Hegel’s <em>Logic</em> above, we find a hint of how exactly Hegel wants to surpass Kantian dualisms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the true objectivity of thinking means that the thoughts, far from being merely ours, must at the same time be the real essence of the things, and of whatever is an object to us.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a truly systematic science, therefore, the thought of a thing must be equal to ‘the real essence’ of the thing. This equality of thought and being is what Hegel calls <strong>Absolute Knowing</strong>. If the <em>Phenomenology</em> is to be understood as an <em>introduction</em> to a systematic science, it must therefore take the form of an <em>ascension toward</em> Absolute Knowing. For this reason, Hegel describes the book as ‘the path of natural consciousness pressing forward towards true knowing’.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In the introduction to the <em>Phenomenology</em>, Hegel explains that unlike many of his forebears (Descartes and Kant amongst them), he sees it as a mistake to establish the rules of thinking prior to actually thinking, or to envision thought as a ‘medium’ through which the absolute is somehow ‘filtered’. The precise reasons for this will be established later. Instead, Hegel wants to begin with ‘natural consciousness’; that is, the way in which we typically think, prior to any ‘philosophising’. This is not at all to be taken as a claim that ‘common sense’ holds all of the answers to philosophical problems; on the contrary, ‘natural consciousness will prove to be only the concept of knowing, or it will prove to be <em>not real knowing</em>’.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Each ‘shape of consciousness’ – that is, each stage along natural consciousness’s transformation – contains an element of <em>untruth</em> insofar as it is not (yet) absolute knowing; and rather than simply ‘doubting’ the shape of consciousness in response to its untruth, Hegel’s approach is to take the negative element – the untruth – and to <em>negate it</em>, resulting in a ‘negation of a negation’, or what Hegel calls a <strong>determinate negation</strong>. What this is, and how exactly it works, will become clearer later on, but here is Hegel’s explanation of determinate negation from his introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the exposition of non-truthful consciousness in its untruth is not a merely <em>negative</em> movement. … only when taken as the nothing of that from which it emerges is the nothing in fact the true result; thus it is itself a <em>determinate</em> nothing and it has a <em>content</em>. … while the result is grasped as it is in truth, as <em>determinate</em> negation, a new form [of consciousness] has thereby immediately arisen, and in the negation, the transition is made whereby the progression through the complete series of shapes comes about on its own accord.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What follows in these notes is a reconstruction of the various stages that Hegel’s <em>Phenomenology</em> covers, as I have understood them.</p>
