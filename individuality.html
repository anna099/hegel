<h3 id="individuality-which-to-itself-is-real-in-and-for-itself">Individuality Which, to Itself,<br>is Real in and for Itself</h3>
<p>With the fall of virtue, the lone individual has reached its apex, and can no longer pretend that wisdom and happiness can be found when one lives outside of society and the way of the world. Self-consciousness has been brought to the realisation that individual action, regardless of its intentions, is always part of a social whole greater than any one person. What this means, Hegel explains, is that ‘Self-consciousness has now grasped the concept of itself, which was initially only our concept of it.’<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Hegel is referring here to the <em>idealist</em> concept of self-consciousness, which served as the starting point of the whole <em>Reason</em> chapter, namely: self-consciousness is that which knows itself to be ‘all reality’.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Now that the individual no longer acts ‘in <em>opposition</em> to immediately existent actuality [i.e. society]’, and instead recognises itself as <em>part</em> of that actuality, it has <em>reconciled</em> self-consciousness and being. In other words, now that it has truly grasped the concept of what it really is, self-consciousness ‘is the category which has become conscious of itself.’<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> In this accomplished state, aware of itself as a ‘permeation of the universal … and individuality’, self-consciousness ‘begins anew from itself, not by directing itself towards <em>an other</em> but by directing itself <em>towards itself</em>.’<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Self-consciousness is now concerned not with <em>ideological</em> motivations, as the knight of virtue was, but with the natural actions of communal, social survival: caring and being cared for, working, education, living and dying. For ‘the man of the <em>Weltlauf</em>’, Kojève writes, ‘what counts is not ideas but concrete action, and it is this action that creates (social, political, historical) human reality.’<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This action ‘alters nothing and opposes nothing’, Hegel explains, because it is no longer carried out in <em>opposition</em> to something (the pain of necessity, laws of society, etc.).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>What is left of the enormous <em>Reason</em> chapter is an examination of this new form of self-consciousness, who acts out ‘the <em>exhibition</em> or <em>expression of individuality</em>’ and has left behind all grand ideology to instead pursue simple self-expression in ‘the pure form of translating <em>not having been seen</em> into <em>having been seen</em>.’<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Accordingly, Pinkard suggests that this is the point in humanity’s development when genuine <em>autobiography</em> emerges. In the pre-modern world, books by writers like Augustine and Peter Abelard were written to fit a religious narrative (of falling away from God and rediscovering one’s religion); Augustine’s <em>Confessions</em> in particular are explicitly addressed to God. In Rousseau’s <em>Confessions</em>, however, the author presents himself as a unique individual, and ‘not just an instance of some more general pattern.’<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>The individual now knows itself to be ‘all reality’, but <em>what is</em> this reality? At first, it is not very much at all: the individual’s sense of itself starts as nothing but an ‘<em>abstract universal</em>’, some <em>potential</em> cause or vocation.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Until a person acts upon the abstract idea of their vocation, it is really nothing more than abstractness. As such, it is still crucial for us to focus on the <em>activity</em> of the individual.</p>
<p>Individuality ‘comes on the scene’, Hegel writes, ‘as an original determinate nature.’<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> A person is restricted – their existence is in some part determined – by the kind of animal they are (an animal that cannot fly, that cannot breathe underwater, etc.), and as such they are limited to a certain range of activity. Within this range, however, ‘<em>the doing</em> of consciousness’ cannot be limited, and the individual is free. The ‘original nature’ of the individual <em>is</em> the individual’s potential, their <em>skill</em> – whether that is the skill of weaving, of painting, of cooking, or anything else. Indeed, Hegel points out that the determinate nature of the individual is not regarded as ‘a restriction which it would want to transcend’: unlike the unhappy consciousness, who dreamt of overcoming its bodily existence (but also knew this dream to be impossible), the real individual enjoys their limited capacities, because it is <em>through</em> them – when they are put into practice – that the individual is merged with reality.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> This coexistence of restriction and freedom is a motif that recurs throughout Hegel’s work. Hegel repeatedly points out that <em>real</em> freedom – freedom that is practical and effective – appears only in situations wherein one is directed by certain norms or restrictions. As an example, consider language: though someone (a Romantic, perhaps) might feel that the rules of language are too narrow, preventing true human expression, what would a language with no rules look like? It would presumably be indistinguishable from a baby’s babbling. It is <em>only because</em> of the restrictions of language that we are able to say anything meaningful at all, because these restrictions introduce a universal regulation to language that makes it communicable to others. On a broader and more political scale, Slavoj Žižek uses the example of rules about vaccinations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The freedom to choose being vaccinated or not is, of course, a formal kind of freedom; however, to reject vaccination effectively implies limiting my actual freedom as well as the freedom of others. … My freedom is only actual as freedom within a certain social space regulated by rules and prohibitions. I can walk freely along a busy street because I can be reasonably sure that others on the street will behave in a civilized way towards me, will be punished if they attack me, if they insult me, etc. – and it is exactly the same with vaccination.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the present context, the restriction in question is the determinate nature of the individual. This determinate nature determines how the individual experiences their environment; in Kalkavage’s words, the individual ‘sees the whole world through the specific coloration of his techno-medium and originality.’<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Furthermore, the <em>actualisation</em> of the individual’s talents serves as a mediation between the individual’s consciousness (their intentions, the purpose of their activity, and so on) and the world itself. This is the <em>rational</em> manifestation of the ‘labor of the negative’ that appeared in the Preface and in the slave’s liberation in <em>Self-Consciousness</em>: through the individual’s doing, they come to face ‘the object as it has emerged from the actor to be outside of him and to be <em>for him</em> as an <em>other</em>.’<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The difference here is that, while the slave’s work brought the slave to an awareness of <em>themselves</em>, the real individual’s work brings them to an awareness not only of themselves but also of their unity with their environment, of the ‘permeation’ of universality and individuality mentioned above.</p>
<p>As a real individual, my activity <em>negates</em> my original nature, since it transforms it from an implicit <em>potentiality</em> into something actual and external to me (in the environment objects and I work in and upon). Activity makes my nature explicit and legible: ‘doing is, in particular, the pure translation of the form of the being not yet exhibited into the form of the being that is exhibited.’<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Consequently, I cannot really know my own individuality until I act upon it.</p>
<p>At this point, Hegel points out an apparent paradox involved in the individual’s activity. It seems that the individual ‘is incapable of finding a beginning for his actions’: in order to act on one’s individual nature, this nature must be known; but it can only be known when it is made explicit in individual activity. ‘The individual who sets himself to act therefore seems to be situated in a <em>circle</em> in which every moment already presupposes the other.’<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Hegel actually offers no clean logical solution to this paradox; rather, he claims that the individual simply begins its activity <em>immediately</em>, without worrying about ‘<em>beginnings</em>, <em>middles</em>, and <em>ends</em>’, precisely because activity itself <em>is</em> the beginning, middle, and <em>end</em> (in the sense of purpose) of itself. In other words, we come to know the nature that inspires our activity because we just ‘get on with it’, and our nature is revealed to us in the way we act. Harris explains this point with a helpful anecdote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The little girl, of whom I once heard in a philosophy class, who asked “How can I know what I think, until I see what I say?” had her feet set firmly on the path towards a Real Individuality that will not deceive itself at least. But, of course, we could ask her how she knew what she was saying if she did not formulate it to herself before she said it.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, we are ready to think about <em>other people</em> again. Importantly, it is not only the individual who has determinate qualities. The object of their work is determinate too, ‘as an <em>existing actuality</em> freed from the doing’.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> The individual looks upon their work, just as the slave of <em>Self-Consciousness</em> did, and recognises it as an embodiment of negativity (since, for Hegel, all determination is negation), produced by the negativity of the individual’s doing. The consequence of this is that individuals in the <em>Weltlauf</em> can compare themselves to one another by assessing the objects of their neighbours’ work. Who has expressed their original nature most skillfully? Who has been limited by their restricted skill? Hegel stresses that these comparisons are only quantitative: there is no ‘<em>exaltation</em> nor <em>lamentation</em>’, no assessments of ‘good’ or ‘bad’, but merely judgments regarding the ‘translation’ of the individual’s original nature from an abstract, <em>in-itself</em> potentiality to a concrete, <em>actual</em> being.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>It is when we enter the realm of others that dialectical tensions start to emerge. Just as we saw with the law of the heart, the exposure of the individual to the public forces the individual to face up to the <em>truth</em> of their experience. ‘In his work, [the individual] has placed himself outside of himself and into the element of universality.’<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> At this stage at least, the individual can be understood as one of Leibniz’s <em>monads</em>: simple and distinct beings who move freely and act in order to express their essence.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The public’s gaze upon the individual’s work reminds us of Leibniz’s remark about monads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monads just have no windows through which something can enter into or depart from them … neither substance nor accident can enter a monad from without.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context of the individual, this means that the Other has no way of seeing into the individual and their original nature; rather, they must make do with an interpretation of the individual’s <em>action</em>. (Here is another instance of Hegel’s proto-behaviourism, which we also saw in his chapter on physiognomy). The public Other, as <em>interpreter</em>, thus has a comparable role to the <em>reader</em> as depicted by Roland Barthes in his writing on ‘the death of the author’. If we imagine the individual and their action as a ‘scriptor’ and a ‘text’, what Barthes suggests is in agreement with Hegel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The modern scriptor is born simultaneously with the text, is in no way equipped with a being preceding or exceeding the writing, is not the subject with the book as predicate; there is no other time than that of the enunciation and every text is eternally written <em>here and now</em>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final words of Barthes’s remark – ‘every text is eternally written <em>here and now</em>’ – is a clue towards Hegel’s own thinking in this section. In <em>Sensuous Certainty</em>, the concepts ‘here and now’ betrayed the immediate particular and gave way to the universal that was the focus of <em>Perception</em>. The ‘here and now’ is not an immediate atom of space and time, but is universal – or, in Barthes’s words, ‘eternal’. Here, in the ‘spiritual animal kingdom’, the individual’s action similarly betrays their (apparent) <em>private individuality</em> and leads the individual into <em>universal consciousness</em> by – as described above – forcing them to consider themselves as the embodiment of <em>negativity</em>, rather than just a practitioner of particular <em>determinate</em> acts. ‘The consciousness which steps back from its work is in fact the universal consciousness,’ Hegel writes, ‘because it becomes <em>absolute negativity</em>.’<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Weltlauf</em> is thus a competition or a market in which individuals universalise themselves through work, through the production of ‘<em>alien</em> actuality’, and in which they seek recognition for their alienated labour by the judging eyes of the Other. The individual is still primary, but in the social world, this primacy is only possible in the context of competition with others. This constant competition for recognition (which we might as well call ‘attention seeking’) is what makes the <em>Weltlauf</em> an ‘animal kingdom’ – or a ‘zoo’, as Robert Solomon more aptly renders it. An individual in the animal kingdom can only fully exist when they are recognised, Solomon points out: ‘not in the crude mode of domination and submission, independence and dependence, as in the “master-slave” parable, but by way of having a place in society, an exalted place as a producer, a creator, an agent of self-expression.’<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> The chaos of the animal kingdom, the lunacy of the ‘rat race’, is all in pursuit of this place.</p>
<p>When the individual was an individual<em>ist</em> – in the case of the Faustian pleasure-seeker, for instance – they began by opposing activity (doing) to actuality (being). The actuality of the world was in a dire state, in need of overturning through the individualist’s activity. For the individual of the animal kingdom, however, the opposition of being and doing is the <em>result</em>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Individual self-consciousness understands its ‘original nature’ to be its <em>being</em>: the in-itself, the intention or original thought ‘behind’ their activity. Their work, on the other hand, is the <em>doing</em>, which – through its release into the eyes of the public, and through the inevitable imperfections of human labour – never entirely matches up with the original being. Now, it is up to the individual whether it is the original intention or the action itself that is considered the <em>concept</em>, with the other regarded as the <em>reality</em> of this concept; either way, the two remain mismatched, and it is <em>work itself</em> that reveals this mismatch or contradiction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In its work, consciousness learns from its own experience about this <em>inadequation</em> of concept and reality that lies in the essence of consciousness. Therefore, it is in its work that, to itself, consciousness comes to be as it is in truth, and its empty concept of itself vanishes.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the real problem with this mismatch: while I change, my works are still out there, unchanging. And they are subjected to the interpretation of a public that, for all intents and purposes, does not know me. So how can I be sure that <em>I myself</em> will be well thought of by others? It seems that me and my work completely fall apart; a ‘vanishing’ [<em>Verschwindens</em>] takes place wherein I lose my authority on the work.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>But – for someone whose primary goal is to express themselves, <em>to act</em> – is this vanishing such a problem? As Inwood writes, the individual ‘did at least perform an action, expressing its purpose in actuality and, from its own point of view, its performance was coherently unified. What does it matter if its work vanishes in the public sphere?’<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> To be sure, there is always a chance that my works and actions might unfortunately be misunderstood, but that’s <em>all</em> that there is: a <em>chance</em>. It is ‘fortune’ that decides how a public work is interpreted.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Thus, the contingent element of my activity is itself contingent. An individual is free to simply keep acting, and to <em>reassert</em> their original intentions in spite of the public’s misinterpretations. Moreover, this second assertion of the intention is more than a simple repetition: it is an instance of Hegelian ‘determinate negation’ – the ‘vanishing of the vanishing’ [<em>Verschwinden des Verschwindens</em>] wherein the public’s negation of the work is itself negated, and the individual moves from mere <em>expression</em> towards an assertion of <em>truth</em>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Looked at in this way, the scrutiny of the public is only ‘a vanishing moment’, as is the work itself. Indeed, even the original intention, the <em>idea</em> behind the work, is not what truly matters. The crux of the matter, the ‘thing itself’ [<em>die Sache selbst</em>] is the ‘unity’ of the whole process: the whole course of action wherein the individual ‘unreservedly affirms itself and is experienced as what endures, independently of the <em>contingency</em> of [their] doing and the contingency of the circumstances, means, and actuality.’<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> Recall Hegel’s comment right at the start of the <em>Phenomenology</em>: ‘the whole is the result together with the way the result comes to be … the unadorned result is just the corpse that has left the tendency behind.’<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> What we are seeing now is the practical individual coming to the realisation of this fact. In understanding the whole <em>process</em> of work to be the crux of the matter, the individual recognises the <em>category</em> in its Hegelian sense: the unity of thought and being (‘the permeation of individuality and objectivity’, as Hegel puts it in this passage) that is brought about as something processual and developmental.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> As Hyppolite puts it, ‘The “thing itself” is actual reality envisaged as the work of self-consciousness, the real at the level of creating consciousness.’<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>The thing itself expresses ‘the spiritual essentiality’ of the individual’s activity, without being equal to any isolated moment of this activity. In this way, it is a new sort of object, ‘born out of self-consciousness as its <em>own</em> object, without thereby ceasing to be a free-standing, genuine object.’<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> This object, Hegel tells us, will go through stages of development that parallel those of sensuous certainty and perception. (A major difference here is that, while those early chapters were concerned with ‘regular’ consciousness, we are now concerned with consciousness of the <em>self</em>.)</p>
<p>At the start of this development, one is conscious of the thing itself only <em>immediately</em>, apprehending it as a ‘simple essence’. In this sense, the thing itself is an abstract predicate that applies equally to all of its moments but does not truly <em>unify</em> them. ‘It is the <em>genus</em> which is to be found in all these moments as its <em>species</em> and which is likewise free-standing from all of them.’<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> Equipped with this sense of the thing itself, the individual embodies what Hegel calls ‘honest consciousness’. This individual is <em>honest</em> because they regard all of their activities – and all moments of their activities – to be honourable. At every step of their journey, the honest individual considers themselves to be engaged with the thing itself, the crux of the matter. Just as naïve sensuous certainty failed to recognise the universality involved in the observation that every moment is always ‘here’ and ‘now’, the honest individual ‘always gains satisfaction’ in the belief that their every move is the crux of the matter, the real heart of their activity.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> This attitude goes so far as to apply even to activities carried out by other people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If finally something of interest to [the honest individual] has come to be without his own involvement in it, then to himself it is this <em>actuality</em> itself which is the crux of the matter just because of the interest that he himself finds in it, which is quite independent of whether or not he brought about that actuality.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The honest individual ‘makes one meaning after another into [the thing itself], and then it forgets one after the other.’<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Indeed, the only thing that unifies these multiple instances of the thing itself is the individual themselves: ‘they are so plainly related to each other’ insofar as ‘The <em>pure</em> doing is essentially <em>this</em> individual’s doing.’<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> In this sense, the ‘honest’ individual is, in truth, concerned above all with themselves, with their own ego. Accordingly, we can see the honest consciousness as a parody of Fichte’s idealism – at least in the form that Hegel understood it. For Hegel, the foundation of Fichtean idealism is the ego’s ‘pure thinking of itself, pure selfconsciousness.’<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> Similarly, the honest individual is self-congratulatory about its activity, concerning any action to be the crux of the matter simply because they deem it to be so. As Judith Shklar writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is really because it is his ‘own’ cause that the ‘honest’ participant cares about it and imputes values to it. His activity is only a reflection of his self-absorption. … He is like the spectator who uses art to display his good taste. Causes [i.e. cruxes of the matter] are a foil to demonstrate his ‘honesty’. It remains a matter of the self playing with itself.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The honest individual is <strong>deceiving</strong> themselves: having no grasp on how their activity’s <em>subjective</em> side (i.e., their investment in it) relates to its <em>objective</em> side (i.e., its supposed status as the crux of the matter), they ‘run from the truth’ by constantly changing their mind about their focus and values.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> Through this deception, however, they also end up deceiving others: when an individual declares a certain cause or vocation to be the crux of the matter, they declare it to be of <em>universal</em> interest: the activity ‘is exposed by consciousness to the light of day and is represented as being <em>for others</em>.’<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Accordingly, other people start adopting and appropriating the activity, and making it their own. But as soon as this happens, the individual has lost what really made the activity worthwhile to them: namely, that it was <em>them</em> doing it themselves. Furthermore, the other people who adopted the activity, having been given no <em>objective</em> reasons to find the activity truly worthwhile, are <em>also</em> carrying it out in a merely self-congratulatory manner. For the first individual, ‘what interests him about the [supposed] crux of the matter is what it has to do with <em>his own</em> goings-on’; likewise, the ‘haste’ of the others to ‘offer their assistance’ amounts to nothing more ‘but their own desire to see and to show off not the <em>crux of the matter</em> but only <em>their own</em> activities’.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> Deception and ‘hoodwinking’ spreads throughout the community.</p>
<p>If this seems too abstract, consider a contemporary example: the ‘hipster’. At least according to the stereotype, a hipster will fanatically praise something (perhaps a filmmaker, a style of music, or a way of dressing), declaring it to be the current Big Thing – the <em>thing itself</em>. However, if other people were to start adopting this Big Thing for themselves (going to see the filmmaker’s films, or listening to that particular style of music, etc.), the hipster would quickly denounce the thing, and perhaps claim that it has been misunderstood by the public: ‘they didn’t get it!’. It is quickly revealed that the hipster’s ‘interest’ in the thing was nothing but self-interest in disguise: it only earned its status as the thing itself insofar as the hipster could claim it as their <em>own</em>.</p>
<p>People will only tolerate such deception for so long. When an individual loses the trust of their community – and, moreover, continues to deceive <em>themselves</em> – they eventually come to the realisation that their conception of their activity is deeply flawed. No matter how much these ‘animal’ individuals compete with each other, ‘still they all mutually learn from experience that <em>everyone</em> is on the move and considers himself invited’ and that, when an overly individualistic notion of the crux of the matter is abandoned, something else is ‘brought into the open.’<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> Through experience, each member of the ‘animal kingdom’ comes to learn that the <em>real</em> crux of the matter is not an exclusively individual thing, but a social thing: it ‘is only a fact insofar as it is the <em>doing</em> of <em>each</em> and <em>all</em>’. This kind of fact, in Hegelian language, is called ‘<em>spiritual essence</em>’.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>As Robert Pippin has suggested, Hegel’s conclusion of this chapter is that a conception of practical reason wherein my activity ‘is rational for me simply if it fits and helps realize my overall life plan and interests’ is, ultimately, <em>not</em> reason in any meaningful sense. Put otherwise, activity can be rational ‘only if tied to the development or realization of a supra-individual subject, <em>Geist</em>.’<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="giving">Law-Giving Reason</h4>
<p>Now that the obsession with the crux of the matter has been inverted and fallen into universal deception, and this deception has itself been inverted and moved aside for the rise of spiritual essence, the scene is set for a new shape of consciousness: that of ‘law-giving reason’. When consciousness takes this shape, it no longer takes its original determinate nature to be the primary, ‘positive’ determination of its activity and purpose.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> Instead, consciousness starts to grasp the ‘spiritual essence’ of society, and focuses on a new object whose existence ‘is the <em>actuality</em> and the doing of self-consciousness’: no more wasting time with intentions, aims, and reputations.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> This new object is <em>ethical substance</em> (or what we might call ‘social substance’), and it holds absolutely for our ethical consciousness: who would want to transcend that which substantiates and is substantiated by one’s own activity (along with the activity of everyone else), and from which actual laws can be derived, so solidly that anyone with ‘<em>healthy reason</em>’ immediately knows right from wrong?<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, Hegel’s repeated lesson in the <em>Phenomenology</em> is that there is always an inherent limit to any such immediately desirable situation. As such, though consciousness now has ethical substance as its object, it is not yet at the stage of Spirit. The consciousness of law-giving reason is still too individualistic; it sees ethical substance all around but does not understand its role in this substance. ‘The individual self is still distinct from the substance of which it is the self, and substance is still separate from this self.’<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>This short section is consequently devoted to undermining reason’s claim that it can devise necessary moral laws – <em>laws of nature</em>, perhaps – simply through abstract rational thought. Such laws always collapse, Hegel will argue, because in aiming for <em>necessity</em> they fail to incorporate the <em>contingency</em> that runs throughout diverse individuals in ethical life. Just like in <em>Sensuous Certainty</em>, Hegel is here demonstrating that immediate claims to truth amount to very little.</p>
<p>The first attempt at an immediately valid law is: ‘everyone ought to speak the truth.’<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> An instruction that is so succinct almost instantly requires clarification: for instance, what if I don’t <em>know</em> the truth? Am I therefore prohibited from speaking at all? Accordingly, the law is revised: ‘everyone should speak the truth, at all times according to his knowing and conviction of it.’ Now, it’s easy to imagine that this amendment might be given with some tone of frustration: <em>of course</em> this law doesn’t prohibit you from speaking simply because you don’t know the truth – even if that wasn’t <em>stated</em>, it should have just been understood! As Hegel puts it, ‘healthy reason … will also explain that this condition is already so closely linked with its universal pronouncements that it is how it <em>meant</em> that the command was to be taken.’ Law-giving reason thus claims that, in giving a law that requires truth-telling, it <em>meant</em> something other than what was directly <em>said</em>… What is this if not a failure to tell the truth? We might grant that the law only had to be revised because a potential misunderstanding was discovered, but this isn’t good enough for a law: what kind of law is ‘left up to the contingency’ of whether or not it will convince people or satisfy its own demands? This law is not as necessary as its expression would suggest; as Hyppolite puts it, laws of this kind ‘manifest a contingency which derives from the individuality of the consciousness that formulates them.’<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Secondly, Hegel looks at one of the most famous ‘laws’ of all time: ‘love thy neighbour as thyself.’<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> He suggests that a charitable interpretation of this rule is that we should aim both to keep others out of harm’s way and to bring good to them. But <em>what</em> good? Is the good for my neighbour necessarily what is good for me? Should I deliver the same good to every individual? This rule can only be meaningful if it contradicts its necessity by allowing room for the contingency of individual ‘neighbours’. Furthermore, Hegel claims (in a rather unromantic remark) that I alone cannot bring much good to another person when my action is compared with that of the wider social community or the state. Further than this, as Harris points out, ‘I can do <em>no</em> good for my neighbour (or myself) unless we are participants in the great common good that we call “the State.” It is our commitment to, and membership in, the community … that enables us to be good to one another.’<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> Consequently, Hegel concludes, ‘the only significance that remains to beneficence is that of sentiment.’</p>
