id="individuality-which-to-itself-is-real-in-and-for-itself">Individuality
Which, to Itself,<br>is Real in and for Itself</h3>
<p>With the fall of virtue, the lone individual has reached its apex,
and can no longer pretend that wisdom and happiness can be found when
one lives outside of society and the way of the world.
Self-consciousness has been brought to the realisation that individual
action, regardless of its intentions, is always part of a social whole
greater than any one person. What this means, Hegel explains, is that
‘Self-consciousness has now grasped the concept of itself, which was
initially only our concept of it.’<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Hegel is referring here
to the <em>idealist</em> concept of self-consciousness, which served as
the starting point of the whole <em>Reason</em> chapter, namely:
self-consciousness is that which knows itself to be ‘all reality’.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Now that the individual no longer acts ‘in <em>opposition</em> to
immediately existent actuality [i.e. society]’, and instead recognises
itself as <em>part</em> of that actuality, it has <em>reconciled</em>
self-consciousness and being. In other words, now that it has truly
grasped the concept of what it really is, self-consciousness ‘is the
category which has become conscious of itself.’<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> In
this accomplished state, aware of itself as a ‘permeation of the
universal … and individuality’, self-consciousness ‘begins anew from
itself, not by directing itself towards <em>an other</em> but by
directing itself <em>towards itself</em>.’<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
Self-consciousness is now concerned not with <em>ideological</em>
motivations, as the knight of virtue was, but with the natural actions
of communal, social survival: caring and being cared for, working,
education, living and dying. For ‘the man of the <em>Weltlauf</em>’,
Kojève writes, ‘what counts is not ideas but concrete action, and it is
this action that creates (social, political, historical) human
reality.’<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This action ‘alters nothing and
opposes nothing’, Hegel explains, because it is no longer carried out in
<em>opposition</em> to something (the pain of necessity, laws of
society, etc.).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>What is left of the enormous <em>Reason</em> chapter is an
examination of this new form of self-consciousness, who acts out ‘the
<em>exhibition</em> or <em>expression of individuality</em>’ and has
left behind all grand ideology to instead pursue simple self-expression
in ‘the pure form of translating <em>not having been seen</em> into
<em>having been seen</em>.’<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Accordingly, Pinkard
suggests that this is the point in humanity’s development when genuine
<em>autobiography</em> emerges. In the pre-modern world, books by
writers like Augustine and Peter Abelard were written to fit a religious
narrative (of falling away from God and rediscovering one’s religion);
Augustine’s <em>Confessions</em> in particular are explicitly addressed
to God. In Rousseau’s <em>Confessions</em>, however, the author presents
himself as a unique individual, and ‘not just an instance of some more
general pattern.’<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"

<p>The individual now knows itself to be ‘all reality’, but <em>what
is</em> this reality? At first, it is not very much at all: the
individual’s sense of itself starts as nothing but an ‘<em>abstract
universal</em>’, some <em>potential</em> cause or vocation.<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Until a person acts upon the
abstract idea of their vocation, it is really nothing more than
abstractness. As such, it is still crucial for us to focus on the
<em>activity</em> of the individual.</p>
<p>Individuality ‘comes on the scene’, Hegel writes, ‘as an original
determinate nature.’<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> A person is restricted – their
existence is in some part determined – by the kind of animal they are
(an animal that cannot fly, that cannot breathe underwater, etc.), and
as such they are limited to a certain range of activity. Within this
range, however, ‘<em>the doing</em> of consciousness’ cannot be limited,
and the individual is free. The ‘original nature’ of the individual
<em>is</em> the individual’s potential, their <em>skill</em> – whether
that is the skill of weaving, of painting, of cooking, or anything else.
Indeed, Hegel points out that the determinate nature of the individual
is not regarded as ‘a restriction which it would want to transcend’:
unlike the unhappy consciousness, who dreamt of overcoming its bodily
existence (but also knew this dream to be impossible), the real
individual enjoys their limited capacities, because it is
<em>through</em> them – when they are put into practice – that the
individual is merged with reality.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> This coexistence of
restriction and freedom is a motif that recurs throughout Hegel’s work.
Hegel repeatedly points out that <em>real</em> freedom – freedom that is
practical and effective – appears only in situations wherein one is
directed by certain norms or restrictions. As an example, consider
language: though someone (a Romantic, perhaps) might feel that the rules
of language are too narrow, preventing true human expression, what would
a language with no rules look like? It would presumably be
indistinguishable from a baby’s babbling. It is <em>only because</em> of
the restrictions of language that we are able to say anything meaningful
at all, because these restrictions introduce a universal regulation to
language that makes it communicable to others. On a broader and more
political scale, Slavoj Žižek uses the example of rules about
vaccinations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The freedom to choose being vaccinated or not is, of course, a formal
kind of freedom; however, to reject vaccination effectively implies
limiting my actual freedom as well as the freedom of others. … My
freedom is only actual as freedom within a certain social space
regulated by rules and prohibitions. I can walk freely along a busy
street because I can be reasonably sure that others on the street will
behave in a civilized way towards me, will be punished if they attack
me, if they insult me, etc. – and it is exactly the same with
vaccination.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the present context, the restriction in question is the
determinate nature of the individual. This determinate nature determines
how the individual experiences their environment; in Kalkavage’s words,
the individual ‘sees the whole world through the specific coloration of
his techno-medium and originality.’<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Furthermore, the
<em>actualisation</em> of the individual’s talents serves as a mediation
between the individual’s consciousness (their intentions, the purpose of
their activity, and so on) and the world itself. This is the
<em>rational</em> manifestation of the ‘labor of the negative’ that
appeared in the Preface and in the slave’s liberation in
<em>Self-Consciousness</em>: through the individual’s doing, they come
to face ‘the object as it has emerged from the actor to be outside of
him and to be <em>for him</em> as an <em>other</em>.’<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
The difference here is that, while the slave’s work brought the slave to
an awareness of <em>themselves</em>, the real individual’s work brings
them to an awareness not only of themselves but also of their unity with
their environment, of the ‘permeation’ of universality and individuality
mentioned above.</p>
<p>As a real individual, my activity <em>negates</em> my original
nature, since it transforms it from an implicit <em>potentiality</em>
into something actual and external to me (in the environment objects and
I work in and upon). Activity makes my nature explicit and legible:
‘doing is, in particular, the pure translation of the form of the being
not yet exhibited into the form of the being that is exhibited.’<a
href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Consequently, I cannot really know
my own individuality until I act upon it.</p>
<p>At this point, Hegel points out an apparent paradox involved in the
individual’s activity. It seems that the individual ‘is incapable of
finding a beginning for his actions’: in order to act on one’s
individual nature, this nature must be known; but it can only be known
when it is made explicit in individual activity. ‘The individual who
sets himself to act therefore seems to be situated in a <em>circle</em>
in which every moment already presupposes the other.’<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
Hegel actually offers no clean logical solution to this paradox; rather,
he claims that the individual simply begins its activity
<em>immediately</em>, without worrying about ‘<em>beginnings</em>,
<em>middles</em>, and <em>ends</em>’, precisely because activity itself
<em>is</em> the beginning, middle, and <em>end</em> (in the sense of
purpose) of itself. In other words, we come to know the nature that
inspires our activity because we just ‘get on with it’, and our nature
is revealed to us in the way we act. Harris explains this point with a
helpful anecdote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The little girl, of whom I once heard in a philosophy class, who
asked “How can I know what I think, until I see what I say?” had her
feet set firmly on the path towards a Real Individuality that will not
deceive itself at least. But, of course, we could ask her how she knew
what she was saying if she did not formulate it to herself before she
said it.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, we are ready to think about <em>other people</em>
again. Importantly, it is not only the individual who has determinate
qualities. The object of their work is determinate too, ‘as an
<em>existing actuality</em> freed from the doing’.<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
The individual looks upon their work, just as the slave of
<em>Self-Consciousness</em> did, and recognises it as an embodiment of
negativity (since, for Hegel, all determination is negation), produced
by the negativity of the individual’s doing. The consequence of this is
that individuals in the <em>Weltlauf</em> can compare themselves to one
another by assessing the objects of their neighbours’ work. Who has
expressed their original nature most skillfully? Who has been limited by
their restricted skill? Hegel stresses that these comparisons are only
quantitative: there is no ‘<em>exaltation</em> nor
<em>lamentation</em>’, no assessments of ‘good’ or ‘bad’, but merely
judgments regarding the ‘translation’ of the individual’s original
nature from an abstract, <em>in-itself</em> potentiality to a concrete,
<em>actual</em> being.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>It is when we enter the realm of others that dialectical tensions
start to emerge. Just as we saw with the law of the heart, the exposure
of the individual to the public forces the individual to face up to the
<em>truth</em> of their experience. ‘In his work, [the individual] has
placed himself outside of himself and into the element of
universality.’<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> At this stage at least, the
individual can be understood as one of Leibniz’s <em>monads</em>: simple
and distinct beings who move freely and act in order to express their
essence.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The public’s gaze upon the
individual’s work reminds us of one specific remark about monads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monads just have no windows through which something can enter into or
depart from them … neither substance nor accident can enter a monad from
without.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context of the individual, this means that the Other has no
way of seeing into the individual and their original nature; rather,
they must make do with an interpretation of the individual’s
<em>action</em>. (Here is another instance of Hegel’s
proto-behaviourism, which we also saw in his chapter on physiognomy).
The public Other, as <em>interpreter</em>, thus has a comparable role to
the <em>reader</em> as depicted by Roland Barthes in his writing on ‘the
death of the author’. If we imagine the individual and their action as a
‘scriptor’ and a ‘text’, what Barthes suggests is in agreement with
Hegel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The modern scriptor is born simultaneously with the text, is in no
way equipped with a being preceding or exceeding the writing, is not the
subject with the book as predicate; there is no other time than that of
the enunciation and every text is eternally written <em>here and
now</em>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final words of Barthes’s remark – ‘every text is eternally
written <em>here and now</em>’ – is a clue towards Hegel’s own thinking
in this section. In <em>Sensuous Certainty</em>, the concepts ‘here and
now’ betrayed the immediate particular and gave way to the universal
that was the focus of <em>Perception</em>. The ‘here and now’ is not an
immediate atom of space and time, but is universal – or, in Barthes’s
words, ‘eternal’. Here, in the ‘spiritual animal kingdom’, the
individual’s action similarly betrays their (apparent) <em>private
individuality</em> and leads the individual into <em>universal
consciousness</em> by – as described above – forcing them to consider
themselves as the embodiment of <em>negativity</em>, rather than just a
practitioner of particular <em>determinate</em> acts. ‘The consciousness
which steps back from its work is in fact the universal consciousness,’
Hegel writes, ‘because it becomes <em>absolute negativity</em>.’<a
href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Weltlauf</em> is thus a competition or a market in which
individuals universalise themselves through work, through the production
of ‘<em>alien</em> actuality’, and in which they seek recognition for
their alienated labour by the judging eyes of the Other. The individual
is still primary, but in the social world, this primacy is only possible
in the context of competition with others. This constant competition for
recognition (which we might as well call ‘attention seeking’) is what
makes the <em>Weltlauf</em> an ‘animal kingdom’ – or a ‘zoo’, as Robert
Solomon more aptly renders it. An individual in the animal kingdom can
only fully exist when they are recognised, Solomon points out: ‘not in
the crude mode of domination and submission, independence and
dependence, as in the “master-slave” parable, but by way of having a
place in society, an exalted place as a producer, a creator, an agent of
self-expression.’<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> The chaos of the animal kingdom,
the lunacy of the ‘rat race’, is all in pursuit of this place.</p>
<p>When the individual was an individual<em>ist</em> – in the case of
the Faustian pleasure-seeker, for instance – they began by opposing
activity (doing) to actuality (being). The actuality of the world was in
a dire state, in need of overturning through the individualist’s
activity. For the individual of the animal kingdom, however, the
opposition of being and doing is the <em>result</em>.<a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>
Individual self-consciousness understands its ‘original nature’ to be
its <em>being</em>: the in-itself, the intention or original thought
‘behind’ their activity. Their work, on the other hand, is the
<em>doing</em>, which – through its release into the eyes of the public,
and through the inevitable imperfections of human labour – never
entirely matches up with the original being. Now, it is up to the
individual whether it is the original intention or the action itself
that is considered the <em>concept</em>, with the other regarded as the
<em>reality</em> of this concept; either way, the two remain mismatched,
and it is <em>work itself</em> that reveals this mismatch or
contradiction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In its work, consciousness learns from its own experience about this
<em>inadequation</em> of concept and reality that lies in the essence of
consciousness. Therefore, it is in its work that, to itself,
consciousness comes to be as it is in truth, and its empty concept of
itself vanishes.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the real problem with this mismatch: while I change, my works
are still out there, unchanging. And they are subjected to the
interpretation of a public that, for all intents and purposes, does not
know me. So how can I be sure that <em>I myself</em> will be well
thought of by others? It seems that me and my work completely fall
apart; a ‘vanishing’ [<em>Verschwindens</em>] takes place wherein I lose
my authority on the work.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>But – for someone whose primary goal is to express themselves, <em>to
act</em> – is this vanishing such a problem? As Inwood writes, the
individual ‘did at least perform an action, expressing its purpose in
actuality and, from its own point of view, its performance was
coherently unified. What does it matter if its work vanishes in the
public sphere?’<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> To be sure, there is always a
chance that my works and actions might unfortunately be misunderstood,
but that’s <em>all</em> that there is: a <em>chance</em>. It is
‘fortune’ that decides how a public work is interpreted.<a href="#fn30"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>
Thus, the contingent element of my activity is itself contingent. An
individual is free to simply keep acting, and to <em>reassert</em> their
original intentions in spite of the public’s misinterpretations.
Moreover, this second assertion of the intention is more than a simple
repetition: it is an instance of Hegelian ‘determinate negation’ – the
‘vanishing of the vanishing’ [<em>Verschwinden des Verschwindens</em>]
wherein the public’s negation of the work is itself negated, and the
individual moves from mere <em>expression</em> towards an assertion of
<em>truth</em>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Looked at in this way, the scrutiny of the public is only ‘a
vanishing moment’, as is the work itself. Indeed, even the original
intention, the <em>idea</em> behind the work, is not what truly matters.
The crux of the matter, the ‘thing itself’ [<em>die Sache selbst</em>]
is the ‘unity’ of the whole process: the whole course of action wherein
the individual ‘unreservedly affirms itself and is experienced as what
endures, independently of the <em>contingency</em> of [their] doing and
the contingency of the circumstances, means, and actuality.’<a
href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> Recall Hegel’s comment right at the
start of the <em>Phenomenology</em>: ‘the whole is the result together
with the way the result comes to be … the unadorned result is just the
corpse that has left the tendency behind.’<a href="#fn33"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
What we are seeing now is the practical individual coming to the
realisation of this fact. In understanding the whole <em>process</em> of
work to be the crux of the matter, the individual recognises the
<em>category</em> in its Hegelian sense: the unity of thought and being
(‘the permeation of individuality and objectivity’, as Hegel puts it in
this passage) that is brought about as something processual and
developmental.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> As Hyppolite puts it, ‘The “thing
itself” is actual reality envisaged as the work of self-consciousness,
the real at the level of creating consciousness.’<a href="#fn35"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>The thing itself expresses ‘the spiritual essentiality’ of the
individual’s activity, without being equal to any isolated moment of
this activity. In this way, it is a new sort of object, ‘born out of
self-consciousness as its <em>own</em> object, without thereby ceasing
to be a free-standing, genuine object.’<a href="#fn36"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
This object, Hegel tells us, will go through stages of development that
parallel those of sensuous certainty and perception. (A major difference
here is that, while those early chapters were concerned with ‘regular’
consciousness, we are now concerned with consciousness of the
<em>self</em>.)</p>
<p>At the start of this development, one is conscious of the thing
itself only <em>immediately</em>, apprehending it as a ‘simple essence’.
In this sense, the thing itself is an abstract predicate that applies
equally to all of its moments but does not truly <em>unify</em> them.
‘It is the <em>genus</em> which is to be found in all these moments as
its <em>species</em> and which is likewise free-standing from all of
them.’<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> Equipped with this sense of the
thing itself, the individual embodies what Hegel calls ‘honest
consciousness’. This individual is <em>honest</em> because they regard
all of their activities – and all moments of their activities – to be
honourable. At every step of their journey, the honest individual
considers themselves to be engaged with the thing itself, the crux of
the matter. Just as naïve sensuous certainty failed to recognise the
universality involved in the observation that every moment is always
‘here’ and ‘now’, the honest individual ‘always gains satisfaction’ in
the belief that their every move is the crux of the matter, the real
heart of their activity.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> This attitude goes so
far as to apply even to activities carried out by other people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If finally something of interest to [the honest individual] has come
to be without his own involvement in it, then to himself it is this
<em>actuality</em> itself which is the crux of the matter just because
of the interest that he himself finds in it, which is quite independent
of whether or not he brought about that actuality.<a href="#fn39"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The honest individual ‘makes one meaning after another into [the
thing itself], and then it forgets one after the other.’<a href="#fn40"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>
Indeed, the only thing that unifies these multiple instances of the
thing itself is the individual themselves: ‘they are so plainly related
to each other’ insofar as ‘The <em>pure</em> doing is essentially
<em>this</em> individual’s doing.’<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> In this sense, the
‘honest’ individual is, in truth, concerned above all with themselves,
with their own ego. Accordingly, we can see the honest consciousness as
a parody of Fichte’s idealism – at least in the form that Hegel
understood it. For Hegel, the foundation of Fichtean idealism is the
ego’s ‘pure thinking of itself, pure selfconsciousness.’<a href="#fn42"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>
Similarly, the honest individual is self-congratulatory about its
activity, concerning any action to be the crux of the matter simply
because they deem it to be so. As Judith Shklar writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is really because it is his ‘own’ cause that the ‘honest’
participant cares about it and imputes values to it. His activity is
only a reflection of his self-absorption. … He is like the spectator who
uses art to display his good taste. Causes [i.e. cruxes of the matter]
are a foil to demonstrate his ‘honesty’. It remains a matter of the self
playing with itself.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The honest individual is <strong>deceiving</strong> themselves:
having no grasp on how their activity’s <em>subjective</em> side (i.e.,
their investment in it) relates to its <em>objective</em> side (i.e.,
its supposed status as the crux of the matter), they ‘run from the
truth’ by constantly changing their mind about their focus and values.<a
href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> Through this deception, however,
they also end up deceiving others: when an individual declares a certain
cause or vocation to be the crux of the matter, they declare it to be of
<em>universal</em> interest: the activity ‘is exposed by consciousness
to the light of day and is represented as being <em>for others</em>.’<a
href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Accordingly, other people start
adopting and appropriating the activity, and making it their own. But as
soon as this happens, the individual has lost what really made the
activity worthwhile to them: namely, that it was <em>them</em> doing it
themselves. Furthermore, the other people who adopted the activity,
having been given no <em>objective</em> reasons to find the activity
truly worthwhile, are <em>also</em> carrying it out in a merely
self-congratulatory manner. For the first individual, ‘what interests
him about the [supposed] crux of the matter is what it has to do with
<em>his own</em> goings-on’; likewise, the ‘haste’ of the others to
‘offer their assistance’ amounts to nothing more ‘but their own desire
to see and to show off not the <em>crux of the matter</em> but only
<em>their own</em> activities’.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> Deception and
‘hoodwinking’ spreads throughout the community.</p>
<p>If this seems too abstract, consider a contemporary example: the
‘hipster’. At least according to the stereotype, a hipster will
fanatically praise something (perhaps a filmmaker, a style of music, or
a way of dressing), declaring it to be the current Big Thing – the
<em>thing itself</em>. However, if other people were to start adopting
this Big Thing for themselves (going to see the filmmaker’s films, or
listening to that particular style of music, etc.), the hipster would
quickly denounce the thing, and perhaps claim that it has been
misunderstood by the public: ‘they didn’t get it!’. It is quickly
revealed that the hipster’s ‘interest’ in the thing was nothing but
self-interest in disguise: it only earned its status as the thing itself
insofar as the hipster could claim it as their <em>own</em>.</p>
<p>People will only tolerate such deception for so long. When an
individual loses the trust of their community – and, moreover, continues
to deceive <em>themselves</em> – they eventually come to the realisation
that their conception of their activity is deeply flawed. No matter how
much these ‘animal’ individuals compete with each other, ‘still they all
mutually learn from experience that <em>everyone</em> is on the move and
considers himself invited’ and that, when an overly individualistic
notion of the crux of the matter is abandoned, something else is
‘brought into the open.’<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> Through experience,
each member of the ‘animal kingdom’ comes to learn that the
<em>real</em> crux of the matter is not an exclusively individual thing,
but a social thing: it ‘is only a fact insofar as it is the
<em>doing</em> of <em>each</em> and <em>all</em>’. This kind of fact, in
Hegelian language, is called ‘<em>spiritual essence</em>’.<a
href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>As Robert Pippin has suggested, Hegel’s conclusion of this chapter is
that a conception of practical reason wherein my activity ‘is rational
for me simply if it fits and helps realize my overall life plan and
interests’ is, ultimately, <em>not</em> reason in any meaningful sense.
Put otherwise, activity can be rational ‘only if tied to the development
or realization of a supra-individual subject, <em>Geist</em>.’<a

<h3 id="sartre">Sartrean Animals</h3>
<h4 class="subtitle" id="a-short-interlude">A short interlude</h4>
<p>It is well known that French existentialism was influenced by
Alexandre Kojève’s lectures on Hegel, where the relation of master to
slave was taken as the centre of Hegel’s thought. In Sartre’s <em>Being
and Nothingness</em>, however, there are some passages that prompt
comparisons with Hegel’s chapter on the animal kingdom (whether or not
this was Sartre’s intention). In his chapter on concrete relations with
others, Sartre explicitly cites Hegel on mastery and servitude, but he
acknowledges that there is a strict limit to the comparison between his
concerns and Hegel’s concerns in that chapter.<a href="#fn50"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>
It is the animal kingdom, I would argue, where Hegel really shares
concerns with Sartre in this regard.</p>
<p>The work of the slave is lonely and bound to be forgotten; so long as
it serves a purpose for the master, no assessment is passed on it at
all. (Indeed, it is <em>through</em> their work that the slave comes to
shrug off the influence of the ‘outsider’s mind’.)<a href="#fn51"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>
In the animal kingdom, however, the gaze of the other individuals
persists throughout, in the spirit of competition: at every stage of my
activity, I <em>cannot help</em> but consider how the activity appears
to others. By acting, the individual ‘has placed himself outside of
himself’, into public visibility.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> It is here that we
notice what Sartre described as ‘the look’ [<em>le regard</em>], where
‘my fundamental connection with the Other-as-subject must be able to be
referred back to my permanent possibility of <em>being seen</em> by the
Other … I see <em>myself</em> because <em>somebody</em> sees me.’<a
href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>When Sartre looks at phenomena like insecurity, shame, and love, he
comes incredibly close to the Hegelian points which I have compared to
Barthes. When, through acting, the individual submits themselves into
‘universal consciousness’ – when they enter themselves into the market –
they betray their individuality, the dimension of their existence that
had seemed to be private. The Other cannot judge me based on my
intentions, plans, and so on; it is only in the <em>actuality</em> of
these – that is, in my <em>activity</em> – that I can be recognised or
(mis)understood. The way Sartre thinks about this is that the
<em>look</em> of the Other betrays the narrative that I am telling
myself about my activity. The ‘secret’ of my activity is not an inner
intention, hidden away from public; rather, it is that <em>visible</em>
dimension of my activity, available <em>only</em> to the public and
hidden from me. ‘The Other looks at me and as such he holds the secret
of my being, he knows what I am,’ Sartre writes: ‘thus the profound
meaning of my being is outside of me, imprisoned in an absence.’<a
href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>The real overlap between Hegel and Sartre here is twofold. Firstly,
both of them claim that the interpretation of an individual and their
activity takes place on the <strong>surface</strong>: as Sartre
writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the Other I <em>am</em> seated as this inkwell <em>is</em> on the
table; for the Other, I <em>am</em> leaning over the keyhole as this
tree <em>is</em> bent by the wind. Thus for the Other I have stripped
myself of my transcendence. This is because my transcendence becomes for
whoever makes himself a witness of it … a purely established
transcendence, a given-transcendence; that is, it acquires a nature by
the sole fact that the Other confers on it an outside.<a href="#fn55"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, it is this surface – not any kind of interiority (private
individuality for Hegel, or a personal sense of being-for-itself for
Sartre) – that holds the <strong>authority</strong> of who I am and what
I am doing. In the animal kingdom, an individual cannot appeal to their
intentions or aims to convince others of the value of their work; the
value is found in the surface layer of the work’s actuality. And for
Sartre, it is a form of ‘bad faith’ to appeal to some interiority and
undermine the authority that our visible existence has on who we are.
There cannot be any disconnect between what we do and what we
<em>mean</em> to do, for Sartre, since the starting point of human
existence is a radical kind of freedom. (It is on this basis that Sartre
rejects psychoanalysis.)</p>
<p>Of course, Sartre didn’t simply repeat Hegel. It is perhaps in the
notion of radical freedom that the difference between Sartrean relations
and the animal kingdom is found. For both Hegel and Sartre, all activity
is a kind of negating: ‘<em>doing</em> is itself nothing but
negativity’, Hegel claims.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> Sartre agrees when he
writes that ‘Hegel is right rather than Heidegger when he states that
Mind is the negative’; he claims that the freedom of the subject
for-itself is ‘constituted’ by the ‘negating act.’<a href="#fn57"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>
However, in the chapter on the animal kingdom, Hegel describes activity
as negating an ‘original determinate nature’ – the particular
restrictive qualities of the acting being (subh as their body). For
Sartre, activity is negative because the choice of one action negates
all other possibilities – he refuses the idea of an ‘original nature’
that is supposed to be negated by an act. Indeed, in existentialism
there is no human nature at all. ‘Existence precedes essence’: first,
the human <em>simply exists</em>, and acts only once they have
encountered themselves in an experience with the Other. The body is not
a restriction for Sartre as it is for Hegel. In <em>Being and
Nothingness</em> he claims enigmatically that ‘I exist my body’; that
is, the very being of the body – namely, as a ‘lived’ thing – is
determined by us and disclosed to us in our activity; is is nothing at
all prior to the act.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>The notion of original nature leads Hegel to a <em>Meno</em>-style
paradox involved in the activity of the animal kingdom. In order to act
in accordance with my nature, I must know my nature; but ino rder to
know my nature, I must first make it explicit <em>by acting</em>. The
Sartrean solution to this paradox is that there is no ‘nature’ that the
human acts on in the first place; rather, the human <em>is</em> its
acting. The activity comes before any ‘nature’, since the individual’s
radical freedom allows them to act without the presupposition of any
restriction or inclination. … Interestingly enough, however, this is
very clsoe to the solution that Hegel proposes himself. The individual
‘has to begin <em>immediately</em>’, he claims: activity <em>is</em> the
beginning, middle, and end of itself, and this idea is seemingly close
to the claim that the human – at least as it is understood in the animal
kingdom – is radically free. Perhaps, from the Sartrean perspective,
Hegel’s insistence on original nature preceding action introduces a
contradiction into his argument. Did Sartre realise the truth of Hegel’s
thought more than Hegel did himself?</p>
<h4 id="giving">Law-Giving Reason</h4>
<p>Now that the obsession with the crux of the matter has been inverted
and fallen into universal deception, and this deception has itself been
inverted and moved aside for the rise of spiritual essence, the scene is
set for a new shape of consciousness: that of ‘law-giving reason’. When
consciousness takes this shape, it no longer takes its original
determinate nature to be the primary, ‘positive’ determination of its
activity and purpose.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a> Instead, consciousness starts to
grasp the ‘spiritual essence’ of society, and focuses on a new object
whose existence ‘is the <em>actuality</em> and the doing of
self-consciousness’: no more wasting time with intentions, aims, and
reputations.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> This new object is <em>ethical
substance</em> (or what we might call ‘social substance’), and it holds
absolutely for our ethical consciousness: who would want to transcend
that which substantiates and is substantiated by one’s own activity
(along with the activity of everyone else), and from which actual laws
can be derived, so solidly that anyone with ‘<em>healthy reason</em>’
immediately knows right from wrong?<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, Hegel’s repeated lesson in the <em>Phenomenology</em> is
that there is always an inherent limit to any such immediately desirable
situation. As such, though consciousness now has ethical substance as
its object, it is not yet at the stage of Spirit. The consciousness of
law-giving reason is still too individualistic; it sees ethical
substance all around but does not understand its role in this substance.
‘The individual self is still distinct from the substance of which it is
the self, and substance is still separate from this self.’<a
href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>This short section is consequently devoted to undermining reason’s
claim that it can devise necessary moral laws – <em>laws of nature</em>,
perhaps – simply through abstract rational thought. Such laws always
collapse, Hegel will argue, because in aiming for <em>necessity</em>
they fail to incorporate the <em>contingency</em> that runs throughout
diverse individuals in ethical life. Just like in sensuous certainty,
Hegel is here demonstrating that immediate claims to truth amount to
very little.</p>
<p>The first attempt at an immediately valid law is: ‘everyone ought to
speak the truth.’<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> An instruction that is so succinct
almost instantly requires clarification: for instance, what if I don’t
<em>know</em> the truth? Am I therefore prohibited from speaking at all?
Accordingly, the law is revised: ‘everyone should speak the truth, at
all times according to his knowing and conviction of it.’ Now, it’s easy
to imagine that this amendment might be given with some tone of
frustration: <em>of course</em> this law doesn’t prohibit you from
speaking simply because you don’t know the truth – even if that wasn’t
<em>stated</em>, it should have just been understood! As Hegel puts it,
‘healthy reason … will also explain that this condition is already so
closely linked with its universal pronouncements that it is how it
<em>meant</em> that the command was to be taken.’ Law-giving reason thus
claims that, in giving a law that requires truth-telling, it
<em>meant</em> something other than what was directly <em>said</em>…
What is this if not a failure to tell the truth? We might grant that the
law only had to be revised because a potential misunderstanding was
discovered, but this isn’t good enough for a law: what kind of law is
‘left up to the contingency’ of whether or not it will convince people
or satisfy its own demands? This law is not as necessary as its
expression would suggest; as Hyppolite puts it, laws of this kind
‘manifest a contingency which derives from the individuality of the
consciousness that formulates them.’<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Secondly, Hegel looks at one of the most famous ‘laws’ of all time:
‘love thy neighbour as thyself.’<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> He suggests that a
charitable interpretation of this rule is that we should aim both to
keep others out of harm’s way and to bring good to them. But
<em>what</em> good? Is the good for my neighbour necessarily what is
good for me? Should I deliver the same good to every individual? This
rule can only be meaningful if it contradicts its necessity by allowing
room for the contingency of individual ‘neighbours’. Furthermore, Hegel
claims (in a rather unromantic remark) that I alone cannot bring much
good to another person when my action is compared with that of the wider
social community or the state. Further than this, as Harris points out,
‘I can do <em>no</em> good for my neighbour (or myself) unless we are
participants in the great common good that we call “the State.” It is
our commitment to, and membership in, the community … that enables us to
be good to one another.’<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> Consequently, Hegel
concludes, ‘the only significance that remains to beneficence is that of
sentiment.’</p>
<p>What Hegel realises in his deconstruction of these ‘laws’ is that the
contingent individuality of a speaker quickly undermines the
universality of the speaker’s claim. This is what Jacques Lacan
understood as the difference between the content of ‘the enunciated’ and
the subject of ‘the enunciation’.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> Think back to sensuous
certainty, where Hegel shows that ‘what is meant’ is, in act and in
fact, ‘<em>inaccessible</em>’ to language and to consciousness.<a
href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> The same difficulty arises here,
when the enunciated universality in ‘everyone ought to speak the truth’
is undermined by the subjective contingency of the consciousness
enunciating it. These ‘laws of nature’ therefore express nothing more
than a ‘<em>formal</em>’ or abtract universality which has as little
concrete content as a tautology.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a> For Lacan, this
undermining is what reveals to us the unconscious (indeed, the subject
of the enunciation <em>is</em> the unconscious subject). Similarly, for
Hegel it is always the surplus element that undermines a claim to
universality that reveals a more comprehensive truth.<a href="#fn70"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>
In this context, it is the (importance of the) subjective position of
consciousness <em>within</em> ethical substance that is revealed to us;
in other words, the emptiness of law-giving reason takes consciousness
closer to the realisation that the subjective <em>and</em> the universal
must be combined in a shared way of life (that is, <em>spirit</em>) in
order for moral maxims to have any concrete content.</p>
<p>If it is always the case for Hegel that the undermining of a claim to
truth is what takes us to a more <em>comprehensive</em> truth, it must
also be the case that the weaker, narrower claim must come first.
Consequently, pre-spiritual reason has one last attempt before we arrive
at the stage of spirit. This last attempt is what Hegel calls
<strong>law-testing reason</strong>, and it is, in some sense, a little
more humble than law-giving reason: rather than trying to
<em>command</em> humanity on the basis of reason or ‘common sense’,
consciousness now sets about to use its reason merely for
<em>testing</em> laws (or maxims) that are already presented to it.</p>
<h4 id="testing">Law-Testing Reason</h4>
<p>At this point, consciousness takes the formal universality that
emerged from law-giving reason’s <em>failure</em> and assigns a
<em>positive</em> role to it: formal universality – that is,
<em>reason</em> and the principle of non-contradiction – is now used to
<em>test</em> laws that are already contingently, externally given.<a
href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> It no longer has the role of
<em>giving</em> laws – seemingly out of thin air – as law-giving reason
did. The test of formal university is simple. Given some maxim, it asks:
is this maxim <em>self-contradictory</em> or not? The principle of
non-contradiction thus becomes the ultimate barometer of morality. As
such, we have arrived at a simplified form of Kant’s moral philosophy as
it was outlined in his <em>Groundwork</em>. For Kant, a maxim can count
as a moral law only if you can act on it while also acting as if ‘the
maxim of your action were to become by your will a universal laws of
nature’ without any contradiction arising.<a href="#fn72"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>
It is precisely this idea that is examined in <em>Law-Testing
Reason</em>.</p>
<p>Hegel takes as an example the maxim that <em>there ought to be
property</em>. In a quasi-Kantian manner, let’s examine this maxim
<em>in and for itself</em> – without any reference to its utility,
potential consequences, intentions, or any other extraneous factor. To
have property means that every individual is <em>entitled</em> to what
they own. There is nothing self-contradictory about this. However, there
is also no self-contradiction in the <em>absence</em> of property, which
would amount to every individual’s <em>lack</em> of entitlement to
anything. Property and no-property contradict <em>one another</em>, but
on their own they are each completely stable. As such, the Kantian test
has told us nothing: it justifies <em>anything</em> that is formulated
as an abstract rule but loses its discriminatory power when competing
abstract rules are placed alongside one another. ‘Just because the
criterion is a tautology and is indifferent with regard to the content,
it incorporates one content into itself with the same ease that it does
its opposite.’<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a> Hegel’s main point here is that
reason, especially in such a formalist manifestation as the principle of
non-contradiction, is totally inadequate in evaluating maxims that are
given in a contingent, socially constituted community. Indeed, this
approach to moral evaluation is not only philosophically deficient, but
is also the sign of an alienation from ethical life; as Judith Shklar
argues, law-testing reason ‘is merely a symptom of a disintegrated
society’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For an Antigone or any completely socialized citizen the very idea
that laws should be tested or could be other than what they are would
not arise at all. That, however is merely a damaging comparison between
modern and ancient politics. To give his criticisms a more rigorous turn
Hegel wanted to show that Kant’s test of universal consistency was of no
use in practice to ordinary men, even though it was meant to be
available to even the meanest intelligence. That was so because men have
only particular and specific obligations and these cannot be
universalized into general, timeless and unconditional duties.<a
href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, in his <em>Encyclopaedia</em>, Hegel repeats his criticism
when he remarks that when practical thinking takes only the
‘<em>abstract identity</em> of the understanding’ as its determining
factor, it ‘does not get beyond the formalism that was supposed to be
the last word of <em>theoretical</em> reason.’<a href="#fn75"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a>
In a way, and insofar as <em>Law-Testing Reason</em> can be taken as
truly aiming at Kant, Hegel takes the Kantian criticism of pre-critical
Enlightenment and repeats it on Kant himself. Kant famously critiqued
the Enlightenment’s insistence on the purity of reason (or observation,
in the case of empiricism) on the grounds of its internal contradictions
discovered by philosophers like Hume and Rousseau. However, in his own
insistence on a transcendental separation of ‘reason’ from ‘nature’
(and, indeed, from <em>spirit</em>), Kant restricted himself to a
‘formalism’ that is unable to present or authorise anything substantive.
‘Without any appeal to what <em>has become</em> authoritative for a
specific community, nor to what in that community’s accounts of why what
it has taken as authoritative really is <em>genuinely</em>
authoritative, no determinate set of moral principles can be
generated.’<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>As such, the law-giving and law-testing manifestations of reason not
only fail to prop up ethical life, but in fact demonstrate a profound
alienation from ethical life. Law-giving reason is ‘the tyrannical
outrage that makes <em>arbitrariness</em> into law’, and law-testing
reason amounts to ‘a freedom from absolute laws [which] takes absolute
laws to be an issuance of an <em>alien arbitrary</em> will.’<a
href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a> In both cases, consciousness
mistakes its own reason and willing for actual ethical substance, which
still remains only in the background (most prominently as the ‘alien
will’ which ‘gives’ reason laws to be tested).</p>
<p>That law-testing reason can equally defend two contradicting laws
reveals to consciousness the dialectical nature of justice, at least
insofar as justice is understood as a principle worked out by an
individual’s use of reason. We have seen that this reason cannot
<em>give</em> laws, but neither can it verify laws given <em>to it</em>
from the hazy background of ‘ethical substance’ within which it lives.
Actual, concrete justice is thus only possible when this background
comes to the fore – when we take as our subject matter the
<strong>spirit</strong> in which critical reason comes about and which
makes it possible for laws to be given or tested in the first place.</p>
