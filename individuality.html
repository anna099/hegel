<h3 id="individuality-which-to-itself-is-real-in-and-for-itself">Individuality Which, to Itself,<br>is Real in and for Itself</h3>
<p>With the fall of virtue, the lone individual has reached its apex, and can no longer pretend that wisdom and happiness can be found when one lives outside of society and the way of the world. Self-consciousness has been brought to the realisation that individual action, regardless of its intentions, is always part of a social whole greater than any one person. What this means, Hegel explains, is that ‘Self-consciousness has now grasped the concept of itself, which was initially only our concept of it.’<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Hegel is referring here to the <em>idealist</em> concept of self-consciousness, which served as the starting point of the whole <em>Reason</em> chapter, namely: self-consciousness is that which knows itself to be ‘all reality’.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Now that the individual no longer acts ‘in <em>opposition</em> to immediately existent actuality [i.e. society]’, and instead recognises itself as <em>part</em> of that actuality, it has <em>reconciled</em> self-consciousness and being. In other words, now that it has truly grasped the concept of what it really is, self-consciousness ‘is the category which has become conscious of itself.’<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In this accomplished state, aware of itself as a ‘permeation of the universal … and individuality’, self-consciousness ‘begins anew from itself, not by directing itself towards <em>an other</em> but by directing itself <em>towards itself</em>.’<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Self-consciousness is now concerned not with <em>ideological</em> motivations, as the knight of virtue was, but with the natural actions of communal, social survival: caring and being cared for, working, education, living and dying. For ‘the man of the <em>Weltlauf</em>’, Kojève writes, ‘what counts is not ideas but concrete action, and it is this action that creates (social, political, historical) human reality.’<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> This action ‘alters nothing and opposes nothing’, Hegel explains, because it is no longer carried out in <em>opposition</em> to something (the pain of necessity, laws of society, etc.).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>What is left of the enormous <em>Reason</em> chapter is an examination of this new form of self-consciousness, who acts out ‘the <em>exhibition</em> or <em>expression of individuality</em>’ and has left behind all grand ideology to instead pursue simple self-expression in ‘the pure form of translating <em>not having been seen</em> into <em>having been seen</em>.’<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Accordingly, Pinkard suggests that this is the point in humanity’s development when genuine <em>autobiography</em> emerges. In the pre-modern world, books by writers like Augustine and Peter Abelard were written to fit a religious narrative (of falling away from God and rediscovering one’s religion); Augustine’s <em>Confessions</em> in particular are explicitly addressed to God. In Rousseau’s <em>Confessions</em>, however, the author presents himself as a unique individual, and ‘not just an instance of some more general pattern.’<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>The individual now knows itself to be ‘all reality’, but <em>what is</em> this reality? At first, it is not very much at all: the individual’s sense of itself starts as nothing but an ‘<em>abstract universal</em>’, some <em>potential</em> cause or vocation.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Until a person acts upon the abstract idea of their vocation, it is really nothing more than abstractness. As such, it is still crucial for us to focus on the <em>activity</em> of the individual.</p>
<p>Individuality ‘comes on the scene’, Hegel writes, ‘as an original determinate nature.’<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> A person is restricted – their existence is in some part determined – by the kind of animal they are (an animal that cannot fly, that cannot breathe underwater, etc.), and as such they are limited to a certain range of activity. Within this range, however, ‘<em>the doing</em> of consciousness’ cannot be limited, and the individual is free. The ‘original nature’ of the individual <em>is</em> the individual’s potential. Indeed, Hegel points out that the determinate nature of the individual is not regarded as ‘a restriction which it would want to transcend’: unlike the unhappy consciousness, who dreamt of overcoming its bodily existence (but also knew this dream to be impossible), the real individual enjoys their limited capacities, because it is <em>through</em> them – when they are put into practice – that the individual is merged with reality.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The determinate nature of the individual determines how the individual experiences their environment; in Kalkavage’s words, the individual ‘sees the whole world through the specific coloration of his techno-medium and originality.’<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Furthermore, the <em>actualisation</em> of the individual’s talents serves as a mediation between the individual’s consciousness (their intentions, the purpose of their activity, and so on) and the world itself. This is the <em>rational</em> manifestation of the ‘labor of the negative’ that appeared in the Preface and in the slave’s liberation in <em>Self-Consciousness</em>: through the individual’s doing, they come to face ‘the object as it has emerged from the actor to be outside of him and to be <em>for him</em> as an <em>other</em>.’<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The difference here is that, while the slave’s work brought the slave to an awareness of <em>themselves</em>, the real individual’s work brings them to an awareness not only of themselves but also of their unity with their environment, of the ‘permeation’ of universality and individuality mentioned above.</p>
<p>As a real individual, my activity <em>negates</em> my original nature, since it transforms it from an implicit <em>potentiality</em> into something actual and external to me (in the environment objects and I work in and upon). Activity makes my nature explicit and legible: ‘doing is, in particular, the pure translation of the form of the being not yet exhibited into the form of the being that is exhibited.’<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Consequently, I cannot really know my own individuality until I act upon it.</p>
<p>At this point, Hegel points out an apparent paradox involved in the individual’s activity. It seems that the individual ‘is incapable of finding a beginning for his actions’: in order to act on one’s individual nature, this nature must be known; but it can only be known when it is made explicit in individual activity. ‘The individual who sets himself to act therefore seems to be situated in a <em>circle</em> in which every moment already presupposes the other.’<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Hegel actually offers no clean logical solution to this paradox; rather, he claims that the individual simply begins its activity <em>immediately</em>, without worrying about ‘<em>beginnings</em>, <em>middles</em>, and <em>ends</em>’, precisely because activity itself <em>is</em> the beginning, middle, and <em>end</em> (in the sense of purpose) of itself. In other words, we come to know the nature that inspires our activity because we just ‘get on with it’, and our nature is revealed to us in the way we act. Harris explains this point with a helpful anecdote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The little girl, of whom I once heard in a philosophy class, who asked “How can I know what I think, until I see what I say?” had her feet set firmly on the path towards a Real Individuality that will not deceive itself at least. But, of course, we could ask her how she knew what she was saying if she did not formulate it to herself before she said it.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
