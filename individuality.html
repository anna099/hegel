<h3 id="individuality-which-to-itself-is-real-in-and-for-itself">Individuality Which, to Itself,<br>is Real in and for Itself</h3>
<p>With the fall of virtue, the lone individual has reached its apex, and can no longer pretend that wisdom and happiness can be found when one lives outside of society and the way of the world. Self-consciousness has been brought to the realisation that individual action, regardless of its intentions, is always part of a social whole greater than any one person. What this means, Hegel explains, is that ‘Self-consciousness has now grasped the concept of itself, which was initially only our concept of it.’<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Hegel is referring here to the <em>idealist</em> concept of self-consciousness, which served as the starting point of the whole <em>Reason</em> chapter, namely: self-consciousness is that which knows itself to be ‘all reality’.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Now that the individual no longer acts ‘in <em>opposition</em> to immediately existent actuality [i.e. society]’, and instead recognises itself as <em>part</em> of that actuality, it has <em>reconciled</em> self-consciousness and being. In other words, now that it has truly grasped the concept of what it really is, self-consciousness ‘is the category which has become conscious of itself.’<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> In this accomplished state, aware of itself as a ‘permeation of the universal … and individuality’, self-consciousness ‘begins anew from itself, not by directing itself towards <em>an other</em> but by directing itself <em>towards itself</em>.’<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Self-consciousness is now concerned not with <em>ideological</em> motivations, as the knight of virtue was, but with the natural actions of communal, social survival: caring and being cared for, working, education, living and dying. For ‘the man of the <em>Weltlauf</em>’, Kojève writes, ‘what counts is not ideas but concrete action, and it is this action that creates (social, political, historical) human reality.’<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This action ‘alters nothing and opposes nothing’, Hegel explains, because it is no longer carried out in <em>opposition</em> to something (the pain of necessity, laws of society, etc.).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>What is left of the enormous <em>Reason</em> chapter is an examination of this new form of self-consciousness, who acts out ‘the <em>exhibition</em> or <em>expression of individuality</em>’ and has left behind all grand ideology to instead pursue simple self-expression in ‘the pure form of translating <em>not having been seen</em> into <em>having been seen</em>.’<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Accordingly, Pinkard suggests that this is the point in humanity’s development when genuine <em>autobiography</em> emerges. In the pre-modern world, books by writers like Augustine and Peter Abelard were written to fit a religious narrative (of falling away from God and rediscovering one’s religion); Augustine’s <em>Confessions</em> in particular are explicitly addressed to God. In Rousseau’s <em>Confessions</em>, however, the author presents himself as a unique individual, and ‘not just an instance of some more general pattern.’<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>The individual now knows itself to be ‘all reality’, but <em>what is</em> this reality? At first, it is not very much at all: the individual’s sense of itself starts as nothing but an ‘<em>abstract universal</em>’, some <em>potential</em> cause or vocation.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Until a person acts upon the abstract idea of their vocation, it is really nothing more than abstractness. As such, it is still crucial for us to focus on the <em>activity</em> of the individual.</p>
<p>Individuality ‘comes on the scene’, Hegel writes, ‘as an original determinate nature.’<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> A person is restricted – their existence is in some part determined – by the kind of animal they are (an animal that cannot fly, that cannot breathe underwater, etc.), and as such they are limited to a certain range of activity. Within this range, however, ‘<em>the doing</em> of consciousness’ cannot be limited, and the individual is free. The ‘original nature’ of the individual <em>is</em> the individual’s potential, their <em>skill</em> – whether that is the skill of weaving, of painting, of cooking, or anything else. Indeed, Hegel points out that the determinate nature of the individual is not regarded as ‘a restriction which it would want to transcend’: unlike the unhappy consciousness, who dreamt of overcoming its bodily existence (but also knew this dream to be impossible), the real individual enjoys their limited capacities, because it is <em>through</em> them – when they are put into practice – that the individual is merged with reality.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The determinate nature of the individual determines how the individual experiences their environment; in Kalkavage’s words, the individual ‘sees the whole world through the specific coloration of his techno-medium and originality.’<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Furthermore, the <em>actualisation</em> of the individual’s talents serves as a mediation between the individual’s consciousness (their intentions, the purpose of their activity, and so on) and the world itself. This is the <em>rational</em> manifestation of the ‘labor of the negative’ that appeared in the Preface and in the slave’s liberation in <em>Self-Consciousness</em>: through the individual’s doing, they come to face ‘the object as it has emerged from the actor to be outside of him and to be <em>for him</em> as an <em>other</em>.’<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The difference here is that, while the slave’s work brought the slave to an awareness of <em>themselves</em>, the real individual’s work brings them to an awareness not only of themselves but also of their unity with their environment, of the ‘permeation’ of universality and individuality mentioned above.</p>
<p>As a real individual, my activity <em>negates</em> my original nature, since it transforms it from an implicit <em>potentiality</em> into something actual and external to me (in the environment objects and I work in and upon). Activity makes my nature explicit and legible: ‘doing is, in particular, the pure translation of the form of the being not yet exhibited into the form of the being that is exhibited.’<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Consequently, I cannot really know my own individuality until I act upon it.</p>
<p>At this point, Hegel points out an apparent paradox involved in the individual’s activity. It seems that the individual ‘is incapable of finding a beginning for his actions’: in order to act on one’s individual nature, this nature must be known; but it can only be known when it is made explicit in individual activity. ‘The individual who sets himself to act therefore seems to be situated in a <em>circle</em> in which every moment already presupposes the other.’<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Hegel actually offers no clean logical solution to this paradox; rather, he claims that the individual simply begins its activity <em>immediately</em>, without worrying about ‘<em>beginnings</em>, <em>middles</em>, and <em>ends</em>’, precisely because activity itself <em>is</em> the beginning, middle, and <em>end</em> (in the sense of purpose) of itself. In other words, we come to know the nature that inspires our activity because we just ‘get on with it’, and our nature is revealed to us in the way we act. Harris explains this point with a helpful anecdote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The little girl, of whom I once heard in a philosophy class, who asked “How can I know what I think, until I see what I say?” had her feet set firmly on the path towards a Real Individuality that will not deceive itself at least. But, of course, we could ask her how she knew what she was saying if she did not formulate it to herself before she said it.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, we are ready to think about <em>other people</em> again. Importantly, it is not only the individual who has determinate qualities. The object of their work is determinate too, ‘as an <em>existing actuality</em> freed from the doing’.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> The individual looks upon their work, just as the slave of <em>Self-Consciousness</em> did, and recognises it as an embodiment of negativity (since, for Hegel, all determination is negation), produced by the negativity of the individual’s doing. The consequence of this is that individuals in the <em>Weltlauf</em> can compare themselves to one another by assessing the objects of their neighbours’ work. Who has expressed their original nature most skillfully? Who has been limited by their restricted skill? Hegel stresses that these comparisons are only quantitative: there is no ‘<em>exaltation</em> nor <em>lamentation</em>’, no assessments of ‘good’ or ‘bad’, but merely judgments regarding the ‘translation’ of the individual’s original nature from an abstract, <em>in-itself</em> potentiality to a concrete, <em>actual</em> being.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>It is when we enter the realm of others that dialectical tensions start to emerge. Just as we saw with the law of the heart, the exposure of the individual to the public forces the individual to face up to the <em>truth</em> of their experience. ‘In his work, [the individual] has placed himself outside of himself and into the element of universality.’<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> At this stage at least, the individual can be understood as one of Leibniz’s <em>monads</em>: simple and distinct beings who move freely and act in order to express their essence.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> The public’s gaze upon the individual’s work reminds us of Leibniz’s remark about monads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monads just have no windows through which something can enter into or depart from them … neither substance nor accident can enter a monad from without.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context of the individual, this means that the Other has no way of seeing into the individual and their original nature; rather, they must make do with an interpretation of the individual’s <em>action</em>. (Here is another instance of Hegel’s proto-behaviourism, which we also saw in his chapter on physiognomy). The public Other, as <em>interpreter</em>, thus has a comparable role to the <em>reader</em> as depicted by Roland Barthes in his writing on ‘the death of the author’. If we imagine the individual and their action as a ‘scriptor’ and a ‘text’, what Barthes suggests is in agreement with Hegel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The modern scriptor is born simultaneously with the text, is in no way equipped with a being preceding or exceeding the writing, is not the subject with the book as predicate; there is no other time than that of the enunciation and every text is eternally written <em>here and now</em>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final words of Barthes’s remark – ‘every text is eternally written <em>here and now</em>’ – is a clue towards Hegel’s own thinking in this section. In <em>Sensuous Certainty</em>, the concepts ‘here and now’ betrayed the immediate particular and gave way to the universal that was the focus of <em>Perception</em>. The ‘here and now’ is not an immediate atom of space and time, but is universal – or, in Barthes’s words, ‘eternal’. Here, in the ‘spiritual animal kingdom’, the individual’s action similarly betrays their (apparent) <em>private individuality</em> and leads the individual into <em>universal consciousness</em> by – as described above – forcing them to consider themselves as the embodiment of <em>negativity</em>, rather than just a practitioner of particular <em>determinate</em> acts. ‘The consciousness which steps back from its work is in fact the universal consciousness,’ Hegel writes, ‘because it becomes <em>absolute negativity</em>.’<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Weltlauf</em> is thus a competition or a market in which individuals universalise themselves through work, through the production of ‘<em>alien</em> actuality’, and in which they seek recognition for their alienated labour by the judging eyes of the Other. The individual is still primary, but in the social world, this primacy is only possible in the context of competition with others. This constant competition for recognition (which we might as well call ‘attention seeking’) is what makes the <em>Weltlauf</em> an ‘animal kingdom’ – or a ‘zoo’, as Robert Solomon more aptly renders it. An individual in the animal kingdom can only fully exist when they are recognised, Solomon points out: ‘not in the crude mode of domination and submission, independence and dependence, as in the “master-slave” parable, but by way of having a place in society, an exalted place as a producer, a creator, an agent of self-expression.’<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> The chaos of the animal kingdom, the lunacy of the ‘rat race’, is all in pursuit of this place.</p>
<p>When the individual was an individual<em>ist</em> – in the case of the Faustian pleasure-seeker, for instance – they began by opposing activity (doing) to actuality (being). The actuality of the world was in a dire state, in need of overturning through the individualist’s activity. For the individual of the animal kingdom, however, the opposition of being and doing is the <em>result</em>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Individual self-consciousness understands its ‘original nature’ to be its <em>being</em>: the in-itself, the intention or original thought ‘behind’ their activity. Their work, on the other hand, is the <em>doing</em>, which – through its release into the eyes of the public, and through the inevitable imperfections of human labour – never entirely matches up with the original being. Now, it is up to the individual whether it is the original intention or the action itself that is considered the <em>concept</em>, with the other regarded as the <em>reality</em> of this concept; either way, the two remain mismatched, and it is <em>work itself</em> that reveals this mismatch or contradiction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In its work, consciousness learns from its own experience about this <em>inadequation</em> of concept and reality that lies in the essence of consciousness. Therefore, it is in its work that, to itself, consciousness comes to be as it is in truth, and its empty concept of itself vanishes.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contrary to Aquinas’s definition of truth as an ‘<em>adequation</em> of thing and intellect’ [<em>adaequatio rei et intellectus</em>], Hegel finds the truth of the individual to be an <em>inadequation</em>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> And we are also far from the Cartesian understanding, where pure thought takes us to a certainty of self-consciousness; for the individual of the animal kingdom, truth is revealed through <em>action</em>, and the truth turns out to be a matter of inevitable contradiction, rather than stable certainty.</p>
