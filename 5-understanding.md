### Force and the Understanding {#und}
#### Appearance and the Supersensible World {.subtitle}

Part A of the *Phenomenology*, entitled *Consciousness*, shows the development
of universality - that is, the development of that which makes objects
thinkable. In sensuous certainty, universality was simply denied; consciousness
claimed to have immediate access to its object as a This. But this claim turned
out to be untrue, and sensuous certainty gave rise to the sensuous universal -
the property - which perception embraced, in its conceptualising of the
individual Thing. This, too, turned out to be mistaken, as the individuality
that perception held to be true was mere sophistry, and what emerged was a
notion of the Thing as being-for-another: a set of relations to other things
(other sets of relations). Perception thereby ended in a deadlock between
being-for-itself and being-for-another. The *unity* of this opposition is what
gives rise to the *understanding*, and its object: the *unconditioned
universal*, or, as Hegel refers to it in the title: **force**.

Force was a central concept in eighteenth-century physics, with Leibniz and
Newton establishing the system of *dynamics* - that is, the science of force
which attempts to find regularity in the apparently chaotic universe: why do
objects fall to the ground? Why do the planets move? What keeps me from falling
through my chair? -- These are central questions of force. Force can therefore
be understood as *cause and effect*, *expression and expressed*, and so on. It
is in this section of the *Phenomenology*, on force and the understanding, in
which objects are first conceptualised as things of force - the *appearance* of
a thing is the appearance of *force's action*: a thing, in this sense, is
therefore a *happening* (a th-ing). Note the subtitle of the chapter,
*Appearance and the Supersensible World*: at the stage of understanding,
consciousness conceives of things as the appearances of supersensible essences;
and the form of these essences is force, or the unconditioned universal.
