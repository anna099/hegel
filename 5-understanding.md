### Force and the Understanding {#und}

Part A of the *Phenomenology*, entitled *Consciousness*, shows the development
of universality - that is, the development of that which makes objects
thinkable. In sensuous certainty, universality was simply denied; consciousness
claimed to have immediate access to its object as a This. But this claim turned
out to be untrue, and sensuous certainty gave rise to the sensuous universal -
the property - which perception embraced, in its conceptualising of the
individual Thing. This, too, turned out to be mistaken, as the individuality
that perception held to be true was mere sophistry, and what emerged was a
notion of the Thing as being-for-another: a set of relations to other things
(other sets of relations). Perception thereby ended in a deadlock between
being-for-itself and being-for-another. The *unity* of this opposition is what
gives rise to the *understanding*, and its object: the *unconditioned
universal*, or, as Hegel refers to it in the title: **force**.
