<h2 id="begin">Reason</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>There is a dramatic change between the eclipse of unhappy consciousness and the dawn of reason. The unhappy subject, who goes again and again on a pilgrimage to the church in order to witness God through a medium, is still ultimately unhappy: for God’s salvation comes only in the heavenly kingdom, when all that is singular and contingent is finally shrugged off. For the unhappy subject, there is no community until we die.</p>
<p>Now, however, unhappy consciousness is no longer at the forefront of things. In Hegel’s enormous chapter on <em>Reason</em> (consisting of over two-hundred paragraphs), the foundations for positivity and a real community, prior to heaven, are established. The key to the success of reason is <em>mediation</em>, which emerged in self-consciousness in the figure of the ‘mediating counsel’ or priest. Now, we (the phenomenological observers) must recognise that what appeared in self-consciousness as three distinct entities – the unhappy subject, the unchangeable God, and the mediating priest – are finally understood as three moments of one unified position: namely, the <em>syllogism</em> of reason. What first appeared as the priest’s mediation between God and the unhappy worshipper is now recognised as <em>reason’s</em> mediation between the unchangeable universal and the singular individual. Reason’s power to mediate is the first appearance of philosophical thought proper, ‘the unity that immediately knows both of the other terms, relates both of them to each other, and is the consciousness of their unity’.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Being the site of mediation between the universal and particular, reason begins with the pompous certainty of ‘being all truth’. The mediating ego or <em>I</em> is thus at the centre of the whole world: we are now in the era of <strong>idealism</strong>. For as long as the self has been conscious of itself – from its earliest desire to the apex of unhappy consciousness – it has had a negative relationship towards the world. ‘Formerly’, Hegel says of the subject, ‘it did not understand the world; it desired it and worked on it, withdrew itself from it, took an inward turn back into itself away from it, and erased the world for itself and itself as consciousness’.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is only now, with reason’s power of mediation, that self and world – thinking and being – are united, one and the same. It is at this point that we can declare Parmenides’ saying: <span lang="el">τὸ γὰρ αὐτὸ νοεῖν ἐστίν τε καὶ εἶναι</span> [<em>being and thinking are one and the same</em>].<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In his commentary on the <em>Phenomenology</em>, J. N. Findlay gives a clear summary of the starting position of reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consciousness in the experience of absolution has risen to the realization that the individual consciousness is implicitly one with the Absolute Essence which is, however, still placed essentially beyond itself. In this realization self-consciousness has been projected into the world of objects, into the realm of being, and it has also identified itself with the universal. It has become the middle term in a syllogism which reconciles the individual with the unchangeable universal, and which thereby sees itself as all truth.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In what particular way does reason ‘see itself as all truth’? Recall that every shape of knowing in the <em>Phenomenology</em> so far begins with <em>certainty</em>: an immediate and often naive claim to truth. The chapter on reason begins in just the same way: Hegel makes a distinction between an idealism that recognises the journey (from sensuous certainty to self-consciousness) that is necessary for ‘<em>proving</em>’ that the I is all truth and all reality, and the idealism for whom this journey is forgotten. In its present moment of certainty, reason fits the latter description. ‘It only gives <em>the assurance</em> of being all reality, but does not itself comprehend this, for the comprehension of this immediately expressed assertion is that forgotten path itself’.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> This kind of naive, asserted idealism is thus only ‘an <em>immediate certainty</em> against which other immediate certainties stand in contrast’: since the naive idealist has forgotten the dialectical overcoming of the certainties in consciousness and self-consciousness (sensuous certainty and the desiring I, respectively), it is unable to overcome these certainties, or prove itself against them.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This point may be specifically directed at J. G. Fichte’s idealism. In the introduction to his idealist system, Fichte claims that ‘to begin with, idealism is unable to refute dogmatism’, and that ‘the dogmatist is equally incapable of refuting the idealist’.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> For Hegel, Fichte is forced to see idealism and dogmatism as incapable of refuting one another because he has ignored the dialectical path that makes idealism <em>possible</em>.</p>
<p>There is a sense here in which Fichte is actually less sophisticated than his predecessor, Kant. As Dieter Henrich put it, Kant’s critical project relied on the fact that ‘before there can be an insight that there is some illusion in this metaphysics, there has first to be an original metaphysics. … Because, in his view, one cannot get to the truth all at once at the beginning, there are necessary stages of the development of philosophy’.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This is far closer to Hegel’s realisation of the historicity of philosophy.</p>
