### Perception {#per}

Where sensuous certainty claimed to find absolute truth in the particular and
the immediate, perception - arising *necessarily* from the dialectic of sensuous
certainty - makes its claim to absolute truth in mediated, simple universals:
precisely, *things*. A thing is a thing with many properties, perceived by a
universal subject. The Thing of perception is the result of the sublated This
that had its origin in sensuous certainty; as a determine negation, a
*not-This*, the Thing is determined by its *mediacy*, its *universality*, and
its *differentiation*. In the Thing, a manifold of properties is unified;
'*many* such properties are posited at the same time, and each one is the
negative of the other'. The universal (that is, the unified Thing)
'expresses' the manifold properties, but the properties themselves are also
determined by '*relating themselves to themselves*', and by '*permeat[ing]* each
other in that universality as a *simple* unity without *making contact with*
each other'. We can consequently say that the Thing is mediated through its
properties, and its properties through itself; indeed, Hegel defines '*thinghood*
itself' as 'a *simple togetherness of the many*'.[^11]
