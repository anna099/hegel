#### Observation of Nature: The Story of Nature Collapses {#collapse}

The great chain of being has given way to the 'unbridled violence' of the Earth.
What this ultimately means is that, as soon as the observer hopes the find a
story that finds rational order in nature, the chaos of the Earth, and the
contingency of organic life, causes the observer to lose her footing. Think of
the failures we have witnessed so far in this chapter: first, the observer found
(what seemed like) universality in nature by relating particulars in the
**memory**, but this process turned out to be inexhaustible and arbitrary: if we
leave the rationality of nature down to the subject's memory, *nature itself*
plays only a negligible role.
