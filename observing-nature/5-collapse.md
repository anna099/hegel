#### Observation of Nature: The Story of Nature Collapses {#collapse}

##### (The following section is unfinished.)

The great chain of being has given way to the 'unbridled violence' of the Earth.
What this ultimately means is that, as soon as the observer hopes the find a
story that finds rational order in nature, the chaos of the Earth, and the
contingency of organic life, causes the observer to lose her footing. Think of
the failures we have witnessed so far in this chapter:

1. First, the observer found (what seemed like) universality in nature by
   relating particulars in the **memory**, but this process turned out to be
   inexhaustible and arbitrary: if we leave the rationality of nature down to
   the subject's memory, *nature itself* plays only a negligible role.
2. Next, the observer tried to construct **laws** that governed the movement and
   development of natural things. However, as the example of Diogenes
   demonstrated, so long as a 'law' is based on *observed experience*, it never
   holds necessity -- and is therefore no law at all.
3. Consequently, the observer turned from mere experience towards
   **experimentation**, in the tradition of Francis Bacon. A new sense of law
   thus arises, wherein a law is not only *applicable* in inductive reasoning
   but also *intelligible* through the concepts it gives rise to. However, in
   generating such experimental concepts, the observer's use of reason becomes
   increasingly detached from the embodied world; we end up with a catalogue of
   universals that have left the corporeal world behind.
4. The observer thus turns to yet another conception of law, wherein natural
   things are understood as **organic**; in other words, the observer *embraces*
   the dynamism and flux of the world, and thus avoids the risk of stable but
   lofty concepts which retreat from the changing world. The first conception of
   organic law claims that organisms change by *adapting* to their surrounding
   environments. But such laws can easily be falsified, and are based only on an
   ambiguous 'relation', which cannot be observed.
5. Next, the observer instead tries to find the rationale for the organism's
   dynamism *within the organism itself*; that is, with the concept of
   **purpose**. However, the observer comes to believe that the organism's
   purpose is *projected onto* the organism (or, more specifically, the 'inner'
   of the organism) by consciousness. Because 'purpose' is not *observable*, the
   observer cannot comprehend the idea that non-human, non-thinking organisms
   might genuinely have intrinsic and purposive teleology. This current
   conception of nature thus falls apart, because the patterns and regularities
   in nature's dynamism cannot be explained by a teleology that is merely
   projected onto the world.
6. Finally, the observer makes multiple attempts to envision organisms as
   twofold: the organism is either an *inner* which is expressed as an *outer*
   (for instance, properties of life such as 'reproduction' and 'sensibility'
   are manifested as certain body parts), or it is the *middle term* of a
   syllogism (of, broadly speaking, inorganic environment and the stream of
   life).
