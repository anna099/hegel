#### Observation of Nature: The Story of Nature Collapses {#collapse}

The great chain of being has given way to the 'unbridled violence' of the Earth.
What this ultimately means is that, as soon as the observer hopes the find a
story that finds rational order in nature, the chaos of the Earth, and the
contingency of organic life, causes the observer to lose their footing. Think of
the failures we have witnessed so far in this chapter:

1. First, the observer found (what seemed like) universality in nature by
   relating particulars in the **memory**, but this process turned out to be
   inexhaustible and arbitrary: if we leave the rationality of nature down to
   the subject's memory, *nature itself* plays only a negligible role.
2. Next, the observer tried to construct **laws** that governed the movement and
   development of natural things. However, as the example of Diogenes
   demonstrated, so long as a 'law' is based on *observed experience*, it never
   holds necessity -- and is therefore no law at all.
3. Consequently, the observer turned from mere experience towards
   **experimentation**, in the tradition of Francis Bacon. A new sense of law
   thus arises, wherein a law is not only *applicable* in inductive reasoning
   but also *intelligible* through the concepts it gives rise to. However, in
   generating such experimental concepts, the observer's use of reason becomes
   increasingly detached from the embodied world; we end up with a catalogue of
   universals that have left the corporeal world behind.
4. The observer thus turns to yet another conception of law, wherein natural
   things are understood as **organic**; in other words, the observer *embraces*
   the dynamism and flux of the world, and thus avoids the risk of stable but
   lofty concepts which retreat from the changing world. The first conception of
   organic law claims that organisms change by *adapting* to their surrounding
   environments. But such laws can easily be falsified, and are based only on an
   ambiguous 'relation', which cannot be observed.
5. Next, the observer instead tries to find the rationale for the organism's
   dynamism *within the organism itself*; that is, with the concept of
   **purpose**. However, the observer comes to believe that the organism's
   purpose is *projected onto* the organism (or, more specifically, the 'inner'
   of the organism) by consciousness. Because 'purpose' is not *observable*, the
   observer cannot comprehend the idea that non-human, non-thinking organisms
   might genuinely have intrinsic and purposive teleology. This current
   conception of nature thus falls apart, because the patterns and regularities
   in nature's dynamism cannot be explained by a teleology that is merely
   projected onto the world.
6. Finally, the observer makes multiple attempts to envision organisms as
   twofold: the organism is either an **inner** which is expressed as an
   **outer** (for instance, properties of life such as 'reproduction' and
   'sensibility' are manifested as certain body parts), or it is the *middle
   term* of a syllogism (of, broadly speaking, inorganic environment and the
   stream of life). Nonetheless, even this sophisticated conception falls apart,
   since nature is not *wholly* captured by it; instead, 'its various forms are
   merely pigeonholed.'[^94] Reason has failed to comprehend the essential
   concept of nature, incorporating its dynamism and variety; the observer
   always gives way to a rigid imaginary structure (a numerable series) or utter
   contingency with no order (the chaos of the Earth).

Clearly, no matter how sophisticated and complex the observer's account of
nature becomes, something remains beyond its reach. Why is reason so unable to find
itself reflected in nature? Hegel argues that this inability is not wholly the
fault of the observer's thinking; rather, there is an insufficiency in the
observer's *object* -- that is, nature itself. As he puts it, 'organic nature
has no history; organic nature immediately descends from its universal, or life,
into the singularity of existence.'[^95] That is to say, when the things of
organic nature come into being -- whether that is by the outer expression of an
inner, or as the middle term of a syllogism -- these things *fall* from the
universal, and 'the whole'. The latter is only 'preserved' in organic objects
insofar as these objects develop themselves qua singular, individual beings; the
wider context of the universal *as a whole* is essentially forgotten. Hegel
expresses this falling and forgetting in the following way:

> The moments of simple determinateness and singular liveliness united in this
> actuality engender coming-to-be [*Werden*] only as a contingent movement,
> within which each is active in its parts and the whole is preserved, but
> within which this vitality is restricted *for itself* only to where it reaches
> its pinnacle. This is so because the whole is not present within it, and the
> whole is not present in it because the whole is not here *for itself* as a
> whole.[^96]

By analogy, think of how Christianity understands humans to be created *in imago
dei*, in the image of God. Human existence thus 'immediately descends' from
Godly existence, but it would not be possible to comprehend the latter purely by
*observing* the former from outside. In just the same way, observing reason 'is
confined to the description and narration of suppositions and vagaries about
nature.'[^97] As Hegel puts it, quite bluntly,

> observation cannot get any further than to *make charming remarks, bring out
> interesting connections, and make friendly concessions to the concept.*
> However, charming *remarks* are no *knowing of necessity. Interesting
> connections* are just that: *interesting.* ... The *friendliness* of the
> individual in playing around with a concept is a childish friendliness, which
> is really childish when it either wants to or is supposed to count for
> something in and for itself.[^98]

If the observer wants to find reason in its object, it will therefore have to
turn to a *new* object: one which carries the universal within itself, by being
wholly for-itself and recognising the journey of its development. For the reader
of the *Phenomenology*, it is clear what exactly this object is:
**self-consciousness** itself, whose conscious journey we have been following
this whole time.
