#### Observation of Nature: The Outside World {#outside}

After all of these failed attempts at constructing laws of the organism
*itself*, Hegel turns to 'the *outer* of the organic' -- that is, the organism's
environment -- and *its* inner and outer. Of course, the observer already looked
at the environment previously, but found no necessity or lawfulness in its
effect on the organism's form. As Hegel acknowledges, 'inorganic nature [that
is, the environment] cannot constitute the aspect of a law vis-Ã -vis the organic
creature, because the latter at the same time is utterly for itself and assumes
a universal and free relation to inorganic nature.'[^75]

In order to preserve this freedom, reason leads the observer to a conception of
the organism as a **mediation**: a 'mediating middle' between being-in-itself
(inorganic nature -- the environment's *outer*) and being-for-itself (pure life
-- the environment's *inner*).[^76] The last time we considered the environment,
the observer looked at the organism as a passive recipient of the environment's
influence. Now, the organism is conceptualised as a more complex being, residing
in a syllogistic relationship *between* life and the environment. 'Life', in
this sense, is what Hegel calls an 'infinite One', which might remind us of his
description of life and infinity in the earlier chapter on the understanding:

> This simple infinity, or the absolute concept, is to be called the simple
> essence of life, the soul of the world, the universal bloodstream, which is
> omnipresent, neither dulled nor interrupted by any difference.[^77]

The life as 'infinite One' which is mediated in the organism also fits this
description: it is not 'interrupted by any difference' because it is a 'simple
negativity', nothing but the indifferent *striving to be*. As Hegel writes, 'It
is a matter of indifference to this stream of life what sorts of mills it
drives.' When it is mediated in the organism, therefore, 'life appears in it as
the simplicity of subsistence [*Einfachheit des Bestehens*].'[^78] On its own,
therefore, life is 'devoid of content': a striving force is nothing without
*that which strives*; it is only in its mediation with nature -- that is, in the
organism -- where life is given an organic shape, and expresses itself. This
makes sense; after all, there is nothing we can point to and say, '*this* is
life itself.'

This conception of 'the organic whole' -- that is, the environment and the
organisms within it -- still shares a similarity with previous conceptions,
insofar as the dualism of *inner* and *outer* works in a relationship wherein
the latter is an expression or manifestation of the former. In this case, the
stream of life is expressed, in its mediation with inorganic nature, as the
organism. Now, since the stream of life is indifferent to *how* it is
manifested, as explained above, only by means of **numbers** can 'the whole
range of differences which develop themselves' in organisms be generalised.
Hegel saw this in the life sciences of his own time in the concept of 'specific
gravity', which 'can be observed just as well as can the determinateness of
number'. Harris helpfully explains this concept which, today, might be a little
less obvious:

> Specific gravity is the 'inward aspect' of the different 'shapes' of matter.
> Hegel conceived of "specific gravity" in strict accordance with its name. It
> was a *specification* (at a higher level of logical development) of the
> primitively undifferentiated force of gravity. In Hegel's interpretation, this
> makes it analogous to our concept of atoms and molecules. What the *number*
> corresponds to in the object ... is a numerically determinate quantum of
> energy.[^79]

Basically, the observer takes the specific gravity of an organism to be the
determinate, numerical signature of that organism: the measure of the organism's
being-for-itself. Number takes the organic flux of the stream of life and
renders it stable and determinate.

But is this not just another attempt to repress the freedom and *in*determinacy
present in every organism? As we saw above, no singular quantity -- whether it
is of a property like sensibility, or of specific gravity as in this case -- can
capture an object as a *whole* of *related*, qualitatively different properties.
If we were to hierarchically order a group of things according to their specific
gravity, nothing about a particular thing's position in a hierarchy would tell
us why it is *qualitatively* such-and-such a way. Again, Harris summarises
Hegel's critique of this kind of hierarchical science:

> Any measurable property that varies progressively can *represent* the essence
> in series of this kind; in other words it can be a *Vorstellung* of the
> essence, but it is not the "Thing itself." The Thing itself would be the
> Concept (and we might say that it is *represented* in a genuine theory). But
> no parallelism of properties in any sequence of bodies could be a Concept of
> the essential nature in its self-differentiation. Serial arrangements,
> therefore, are not what we ought to be trying to establish; organizing things
> in "series" is not yet "science."[^80]

With the failure of this numerical classification, reason moves onto the final
stage of observing nature. As we just saw, an organism cannot be understood merely
by reference to a particular property that it has. For a start, the properties
of a *living* organism are always undergoing change; secondly, these changes
always emerge from a relationship with the *outside*, the environment. In other
words, an organism has *otherness* as a constitutive element of itself, and thus
cannot be grasped via some self-contained property. As Hegel puts it, 'the
being-for-itself of the organically-living ... has the principle of *otherness*
in its own self.'[^81] In a dense web of words, Hegel defines 'the inner of the
organic' as 'the unity of the self-equal self-relating-to-itself and pure
negativity.' What does this mean?

We can understand this conception of the organic being by contrasting it with an
inorganic being. In an inorganic being, like a stone, the 'inner' is one
property among others, just like specific gravity. Though it might underpin
other properties, like a stone's solidity, it never 'reaches outside' of the
inorganic thing itself; in other words, it does not manifest the *striving* that
is so essential to the stream of life. An organic being, however, is organic
precisely *because* it strives and exhibits life. The organic being not only
responds to its outer environment, but transforms itself in its striving to
survive in this environment. The ultimate act of survival is reproduction, where
the organism *transcends* its own death by continuing the existence of its
inner, its universal aspect. Understood like this, this aspect -- the *inner* of
the organism -- is the **genus**. In clarifying this point, Hegel continues the
comparison between organic and inorganic beings: a *property*, like specific
gravity, resides in inorganic (and organic) beings as '*One Determinateness*',
belonging exclusively to a particular being, and eventually withering away when
the being is destroyed (or dies, in the case of organic beings). 'However',
Hegel explains, 'the freedom of the *genus* is a universal freedom and is
indifferent to this shape, or indifferent to its actuality.'[^82] That is, the
inner universal element of an organism -- its genus -- has no regard for
*individual* instances of itself; rather, it is concerned only with reproducing
itself *as universal*, continuing its existence. *Sialia*, the genus to which
bluebirds belong, is indifferent to which particular bluebird it is manifest in:
it is a universal with the sole 'purpose' of striving to continue its existence.
When a bluebird mates and has offspring, it is *externalising* itself from
itself and thereby continuing the existence of its universal inner; this is the
activity of the 'pure negativity' that Hegel referred to. In Hyppolite's words,

> life as universal manifests itself ... as the interior of the living being,
> without a means of expression proper to it -- as the process of the living
> being's life which finally negates that being in the uninterrupted production
> of other living beings.[^83]

The observer thus replaces *number* with *genus* as the concept at the heart of
organic nature, and admits that 'number itself can thus only be taken as a kind
of play in the organic but *not as the essence of its vitality*.'[^84] It is the
pure negativity of genus -- the repelling of itself from itself in
reproduction and death -- that animates organic nature, in just the way that
consciousness in the *Phenomenology* is urged forward by the negativity of
dialectics. (Of course, at this point, consciousness does not see this
similarity.)
