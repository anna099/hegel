### Prelude

#### History in the *Phenomenology*

According to György Lukács, in the *Phenomenology* the entirety of human history
(up to 1807, at least) is 'traversed *three times*'.[^1] Using the terms that
Hegel adopts later in the *Encyclopaedia*, Lukács considers these three
repetitions to be concerned with *subjective spirit*, *objective spirit*, and
finally *absolute spirit*. The first part covers the development of *thought*
throughout history, from sensuous certainty to law-testing reason. The second
part, which consists only of the chapter on *Spirit*, repeats this historical
account from the perspective of the objective -- social -- context in which
thought takes place. Finally, in the chapters on *Religion* and *Absolute
Knowing*, we arrive at an absolute standpoint where the whole of history can be
surveyed at once and the 'laws *governing the movement* of history' or 'the
dialectics of reality' can be comprehended.[^2] In this interpretation, the
*Phenomenology of Spirit* is literally a history book; sensuous certainty is
understood to be chronologically prior to perception, phrenology is understood
as a successor (at least indirectly) to Baconian science, and so on.

This view of Hegel's book is not very popular anymore. For a start, if Hegel
were really trying to write a history, he would have made some significant
errors: for example, the unhappy consciousness he describes quite early in the
book exhibits a religious alienation (separation from God) that has manifested
*throughout* history, in some cases after Hegel's death (for example, in
Kierkegaard). And although there are some coincidental accuracies in the
ordering of positions (Augustine, for example, was a skeptic before he was an
unhappy Christian, just like the *Phenomenology*'s protagonist), they are
outnumbered by the *in*accuracies (in Hegel's narrative, stoicism precedes
skepticism; in Greece, Pyrrho preceded Zeno). However, these points could be
interpreted as signs that Hegel merely wrote a *bad* history -- not that he
didn't intend to write a history at all. Michael N. Forster defends Lukács's
reading on the basis of certain remarks that Hegel himself makes:[^3]

> The series of the figurations of consciousness which consciousness traverses
> on this path is the **full history** of the *cultivation* of consciousness
> into science.[^4]

> Only the whole spirit is in time, and the shapes, which are shapes of the
> whole *spirit* as such, exhibit themselves **in a sequence**
> [*Aufeinanderfolger*], one after the other.[^5]

Is it really the case, however, that 'history' or 'sequence' in this sense
necessarily refers to the *actual* history of humanity, in the precise order
that it took place? It is more accurate to think of the *Phenomenology* as a
narrative of the development of thought (and subjectivity, society, and so on)
that *takes the shape of a history* but is not itself directly correspondent
with 'real' history. In what we have read so far, the concrete historical
phenomena named by Hegel have only been *examples of manifestations* of
particular shapes of consciousness, and this is wholly distinct from them
*being* these shapes exactly. Hegel acknowledges this explicitly when he writes
in the *Self-Consciousness* chapter: 'As it has consciously appeared in the
history of spirit, this freedom of self-consciousness has, as is well known,
been called *stoicism*.'[^6] The 'real' stoicism -- that is, the movement
elaborated by Zeno, Seneca, and so on -- is simply one 'conscious appearance' in
history of what Hegel is talking about (albeit a particularly prominent
appearance). The narrative depicted in the *Phenomenology* is thus a possible
manifestation of the development of consciousness -- a development whose stages
manifest in contingent ways but is nonetheless governed by the necessity of
logic.

With that being said, it is nonetheless the case that the chapters on *Spirit*
and *Religion* are more consciously informed by 'real' history. We will see in
*Spirit*, for example, that the Enlightenment reaches its truth in a revolution
which eventually culminates in 'terror' -- and this, of course, is precisely
what happened in Europe at the turn of the nineteenth century. This relates to
what Lukács got *right* about the structure of the *Phenomenology*: namely, that
it is in the *Spirit* chapter that the history of society is foregrounded, no
longer a 'shadowy, enigmatic backcloth' for the development of *individual*
consciousness, but rather 'a coherent rational order' that allows us to
comprehend 'the rise of modern civil society' (which, according to Lukács, is
Hegel's central preoccupation).[^7]

#### From Nature to Spirit {#from}

As such, we are now at the moment where spirit comes to the foreground of
Hegel's focus. Given the title of the book -- the *Phenomenology of*
***Spirit*** -- we can be forgiven for being surprised that it has taken so long
for this to happen. We might be especially surprised, given that the concept of
'spirit', though it has been used quite a few times, is still without a concrete
definition. Nonetheless, we can find some clarifications by looking back to the
preface. In §25, Hegel makes two important remarks: firstly, 'That the true is
only actual as a system, or, that substance is essentially subject, is expressed
in the representation that expresses the absolute as *spirit*.' Secondly,
'Spirit knowing itself as spirit is *science*. Science is its actuality.' What
are we to make of this? For a start, Hegel seems to suggest that in order for us
to achieve philosophy's goal of conceiving the true (or the absolute) not just
as substance but also as subject, we must express the absolute 'as
*spirit*.'[^8] Secondly, spirit *is* -- it achieves its actuality -- through
knowing itself, and this self-knowledge is what Hegel calls 'science', or
systematic philosophy. Consequently, we can take from these remarks that, for
philosophy to rise from 'the love of knowing' to 'actual knowing' (§5), we must
conceive of the absolute as something that comes to understand itself and that,
through this process of self-interpretation, also becomes more actualised.

This seems still quite abstract, however, and it leaves us with a rather general
and unhelpful definition of 'spirit' (as 'that which is actualised through its
self-interpretation'). Things become clearer when we put them in their proper
context. The *Phenomenology* was the first text of Hegel's split with Schelling,
and its central concept of spirit is crucial to this split and to Hegel's
attempt to render himself independent from Schelling. In his works at the start
of the nineteenth century (which are now understood to be his *early* works),
Schelling emphasises life, organicism, and -- most especially -- *nature* in his
account of the absolute. As Frederick Beiser writes, Schelling got close to
'virtually equating the standpoint of absolute identity with nature itself.'[^9]
However, this led to Schelling taking a quasi-Romantic stance towards the
absolute -- that is, a view wherein absolute truth can only be expressed
artistically or poetically. Philosophy must begin, Schelling claims, with an
'utterly nonobjective principle' which cannot be 'apprehended through
concepts.'[^10] Such a principle, he argues, can be intuited only artistically;
'The work of art merely reflects to me what is otherwise not reflected by
anything, namely that absolutely identical which has already divided itself even
in the self.'[^11] Schelling's view is that philosophy, being a form of thought
and therefore based in concepts and distinctions, cannot represent nature in its
absolute unity; rather, this unity can only be intuited by artistic means. This
is precisely Hegel's problem with Schelling; we might imagine that, when Hegel
refers to philosophers who 'take what thought has torn asunder and then stir it
all together into a smooth mélange' and who merely 'fabricate the feeling of the
essence' of reality, he is referring not only to the Romantics but also to
Schelling's *Naturphilosophie* with its insistence on an unconscious, pre- (and
indeed anti-) conceptual 'nature'.[^12] In Schellingian *Naturphilosophie*,
Hegel argues, we find that 'spirit has shown itself to be so impoverished that
it seems to yearn for its refreshment only in the meagre feeling of
divinity.'[^13]

The second problem for Hegel is that Schelling's insistence on *unity*, on
nature/absolute as the pure identity of identity, results in an emptied-out
philosophy that has no room for the qualitative difference that
self-consciousness, society, and so on are characterised by. In Schelling's
words, 'Absolute identity *simply is* and is as certain as the proposition A = A
is.'[^14] Considered from the viewpoint of *absolute truth*, therefore, A = A is
the most accurate -- in fact, the *only* -- description of reality; 'there is no
difference, distinction, or multiplicity in that dark night', as Beiser
writes.[^15] This 'night' is precisely what Hegel takes issue with, for how can
an unconscious darkness of pure identity give rise to the 'self-originating,
self-differentiating wealth of shapes' that philosophy is supposed to
comprehend?[^16] Accordingly, Hegel famously regards the absolute of
*Naturphilosophie* as 'the night in which all cows are black': from the
viewpoint of the Schellingian absolute, everything is reduced to sameness, and
nothing beside remains.[^17]

Given that Hegel was something of a Schellingian for some time, it seems that he
regarded *Naturphilosophie* as one of the most sophisticated attempts at
conceiving the absolute as a *substance* (nature, in this case) -- and not as
*subject*, as Fichte had done. Schelling had gone further than Fichte, but
nonetheless arrived at a dead end. Therefore, Hegel's project to overcome
Schelling was to conceive of something 'higher' than nature, which avoids the
two problems outlined above: that is, something which is both accessible to
consciousness and allows for qualitative difference. 'The originality of Hegel's
thought', Hyppolite writes, 'does not lie in its concept of Life but in the
philosophical attempt to conceptualize life by means of a dialectic which
permits "finite determinations" to be engulfed in [but not erased by] "the
indifferent".'[^18] This conception of life is spirit. Spirit (when fully
actualised through its self-understanding) is absolute reality *aware of itself
as both substance and subject*. Being self-understanding, and thereby
incorporating subjectivity and negativity, it makes sense that spirit is a
notion that serves philosophy better than nature with all its quiet stillness.
But what does it mean to say that spirit is 'higher' than nature?

In an 1802 work on natural law, Hegel claims that nature is merely the
'actuality' -- the manifestation -- of the absolute, while spirit is both the
manifestation *and* the *reflection* of the absolute into itself: 'the recovery
of the universe into itself.'[^19] When something is reflected into itself (that
is, when it becomes capable of understanding itself), it does not become
something entirely different; as such, it would be a mistake to understand
spirit as something *supernatural*, utterly 'beyond' nature. Rather, it is
'higher' than nature insofar as it is more *developed*; it is able to give an
explicit account for itself while nature remains dormant, waiting to be
interpreted by something outside of itself. When Kant, in his *Anthropology*,
claims that 'physiological' knowledge is the knowledge 'of *what nature makes of
the human being*', and 'pragmatic' knowledge is of 'what he as a free-acting
being *makes of himself*', he unknowingly anticipates Hegel's emphasis on the
spiritual dimension of human life as something more developed than the natural
dimension.[^20] As we will see, the chapter on spirit features repeated triumphs
of spirit (in the form of culture, universality, and so on) over the simplicity
of nature, right from the start.

#### Another Beginning {#anot}

Rational consciousness promised itself that it was 'all reality', 'all truth';
however, being uncomprehending of its place in society and history, this promise
is nothing more than a naïve assertion.[^21] For spirit, however, 'the certainty
of being all reality has been elevated to truth.'[^22] Note that it would be
inaccurate to refer to 'spiritual consciousness' in the way that we refer to
'rational consciousness', precisely because spirit inherently belongs to a
*collective* in a way that reason does not.

In the opening paragraph to the chapter on Spirit, Hegel refers to observing
reason. The *truth* of observation, he claims -- that is, the ultimate outcome
of its internal logic -- is the *sublation* of an 'immediate instinct for
finding, the sublation of this *unconscious existence* of the truth.'[^23] What
does he mean by this? Recall that the conclusion of observing reason was:
'spirit is a bone.'[^24] The 'sublation' of this insane statement is how,
eventually (after a detour in the 'Actualisation' chapter into the origins of
sociality), the 'truth' of spirit emerges from its 'unconscious existence'. A
sublation (*Aufhebung*) is a double (or 'determinate') negation. The first
moment in the sublation of 'spirit is a bone' is immediate incredulity: *of
course* this statement is false, 'spirit' and 'bone' completely contradict one
another! The second moment is the truly Hegelian moment, where negativity is
itself negated into a positive: spirit *is* this contradiction... Spirit is that
element of human existence which cannot be found in the dead nature of a bone;
it is in its spiritual existence that human society is 'higher' than nature. Put
more concisely: spirit is that in virtue of which I am more than what I am made
of, more than the sum of my parts.

'All the previous shapes of consciousness are abstractions from [spirit]',
according to Hegel.[^25] As such, and as mentioned above, spirit is often
present *implicitly* or in the background of the *Phenomenology*'s earlier
stages. For instance, the 'ethical substance' we saw in Reason is accordingly
brought now to self-awareness, and becomes '*ethical actuality*'.[^26] The
present chapter is therefore a step forwards and a step backwards: literally we
(the phenomenological observers) go 'back in time' to the Greece of Sophocles,
but we do this with a uniquely *modern* capacity for critical reason. Harris
explains this perfectly:

> It is not Sophocles, or even Plato, who are "more advanced" than Kant. It is
> rather we who, because we stand upon Kant's shoulders, can see and why the
> Hellenism of Schiller and Hölderlin is an advance over Kant. Kant knew more
> than anyone had ever known before him. But he knew it all "falsely", because
> he did not grasp that a rational order must uncritically *be*, before anyone
> can critically "have" Reason at all.[^27]

It is in this sense that Hegel begins with a return to the ancient world in this
chapter, not because he glorifies it as a lost, perfect society, but because it
was a society of the 'unwritten law' which, demanding interpretation, gives rise
to authentic ethical life, as opposed to the mere maxim-testing of Kantian
morality.

Before he begins the analysis of ancient spirit, Hegel gives a short summary of
the whole forthcoming chapter: firstly, spirit is present only abstractly or
immediately, as 'the formal universality of law.'[^28] Through the eventual
'estrangement' (alienation) of people from this law, we witness the stage of
'*cultural formation*' (*Bildung*) which, at its climactic moment, undergoes a
'revolution' and gives rise to the Enlightenment. In the Enlightenment, Hegel
claims, 'the *conscience* of spirit' becomes aware of itself, and gives form to
a system of morality, comparable to but nonetheless more sophisticated than the
quasi-Kantian system we have already seen. For now, however, this long journey
begins with Sophocles' *Antigone* and the 'ethical life' which it represents.

(Since Hegel is not engaged in a literary analysis of *Antigone*, and is merely
interested in using the play as an illustration for his ideas, a short summary
of the story is enough to understand his references to it. Antigone is the main
character; she is the daughter of Oedipus, the dead king, and is mourning the
death of her brothers Polynices and Eteocles, who died fighting each other.
Creon, the new king of Thebes, has honoured Eteocles and consequently decided
that Polynices is to be shamed and given no proper burial. Antigone, out of a
sense of familial duty, opts to become 'a pious criminal' by burying her brother
against Creon's demands. She is consequently sentenced to death by Creon, and is
buried alive. She hangs herself in the cave. Creon's son, Haemon, loved Antigone
and is so upset at Creon's decision (and Antigone's suicide) that he too kills
himself, which causes Creon to condemn himself with grief and guilt.)
