## Spirit {#begin}

### Prelude

#### History in the *Phenomenology*

According to György Lukács, in the *Phenomenology* the entirety of human history
(up to 1807, at least) is 'traversed *three times*'.[^1] Using the terms that
Hegel adopts later in the *Encyclopaedia*, Lukács considers these three
repetitions to be concerned with *subjective spirit*, *objective spirit*, and
finally *absolute spirit*. The first part covers the development of *thought*
throughout history, from sensuous certainty to law-testing reason. The second
part, which consists only of the chapter on *Spirit*, repeats this historical
account from the perspective of the objective -- social -- context in which
thought takes place. Finally, in the chapters on *Religion* and *Absolute
Knowing*, we arrive at an absolute standpoint where the whole of history can be
surveyed at once and the 'laws *governing the movement* of history' or 'the
dialectics of reality' can be comprehended.[^2] In this interpretation, the
*Phenomenology of Spirit* is literally a history book; sensuous certainty is
understood to be chronologically prior to perception, phrenology is understood
as a successor (at least indirectly) to Baconian science, and so on.

This view of Hegel's book is not very popular anymore. For a start, if Hegel
were really trying to write a history, he would have made some significant
errors: for example, the unhappy consciousness he describes quite early in the
book exhibits a religious alienation (separation from God) that has manifested
*throughout* history, in some cases after Hegel's death (for example, in
Kierkegaard). And although there are some coincidental accuracies in the
ordering of positions (Augustine, for example, was a skeptic before he was an
unhappy Christian, just like the *Phenomenology*'s protagonist), they are
outnumbered by the *in*accuracies (in Hegel's narrative, stoicism precedes
skepticism; in Greece, Pyrrho preceded Zeno). However, these points could be
interpreted as signs that Hegel merely wrote a *bad* history -- not that he
didn't intend to write a history at all. Michael N. Forster defends Lukács's
reading on the basis of certain remarks that Hegel himself makes:[^3]

> The series of the figurations of consciousness which consciousness traverses
> on this path is the **full history** of the *cultivation* of consciousness
> into science.[^4]

> Only the whole spirit is in time, and the shapes, which are shapes of the
> whole *spirit* as such, exhibit themselves **in a sequence**
> [*Aufeinanderfolger*], one after the other.[^5]

Is it really the case, however, that 'history' or 'sequence' in this sense
necessarily refers to the *actual* history of humanity, in the precise order
that it took place? It is more accurate to think of the *Phenomenology* as a
narrative of the development of thought (and subjectivity, society, and so on)
that *takes the shape of a history* but is not itself directly correspondent
with 'real' history. In what we have read so far, the concrete historical
phenomena named by Hegel have only been *examples of manifestations* of
particular shapes of consciousness, and this is wholly distinct from them
*being* these shapes exactly. Hegel acknowledges this explicitly when he writes
in the *Self-Consciousness* chapter: 'As it has consciously appeared in the
history of spirit, this freedom of self-consciousness has, as is well known,
been called *stoicism*.'[^6] The 'real' stoicism -- that is, the movement
elaborated by Zeno, Seneca, and so on -- is simply one 'conscious appearance' in
history of what Hegel is talking about (albeit a particularly prominent
appearance). The narrative depicted in the *Phenomenology* is thus a possible
manifestation of the development of consciousness -- a development whose stages
manifest in contingent ways but is nonetheless governed by the necessity of
logic.

With that being said, it is nonetheless the case that the chapters on *Spirit*
and *Religion* are more consciously informed by 'real' history. We will see in
*Spirit*, for example, that the Enlightenment reaches its truth in a revolution
which eventually culminates in 'terror' -- and this, of course, is precisely
what happened in Europe at the turn of the nineteenth century. This relates to
what Lukács got *right* about the structure of the *Phenomenology*: namely, that
it is in the *Spirit* chapter that the history of society is foregrounded, no
longer a 'shadowy, enigmatic backcloth' for the development of *individual*
consciousness, but rather 'a coherent rational order' that allows us to
comprehend 'the rise of modern civil society' (which, according to Lukács, is
Hegel's central preoccupation).[^7]

#### What is Spirit?

As such, we are now at the moment where spirit comes to the foreground of the
book's focus. Given the title of the book -- the *Phenomenology of* ***Spirit***
-- we can be forgiven for being surprised that it has taken so long for this to
happen. We might be especially surprised, given that the concept of 'spirit',
thought it has been used quite a few times, is still without a concrete
definition. Nonetheless, we can find some clarifications by looking back to the
preface. In §25, Hegel makes two important remarks: firstly, 'That the true is
only actual as a system, or, that substance is essentially subject, is expressed
in the representation that expresses the absolute as *spirit*.' Secondly,
'Spirit knowing itself as spirit is *science*. Science is its actuality.' What
are we to make of this? For a start, Hegel seems to suggest that in order for us
to achieve philosophy's goal of conceiving the true (or the absolute) not just
as substance but also as subject, we must express the absolute 'as
*spirit*.'[^8] Secondly, spirit *is* -- it achieves its actuality -- through
knowing itself, and this self-knowledge is what Hegel calls 'science', or
systematic philosophy. Consequently, we can take from these remarks that, for
philosophy to rise from 'the love of knowing' to 'actual knowing' (§5), we must
conceive of the absolute as something that comes to understand itself and that,
through this process of self-interpretation, also becomes more actualised.

This seems far too abstract, however, and it leaves us with a rather general and
unhelpful definition of 'spirit' (as 'that which is actualised through its
self-interpretation'). Things become clearer when we put them in their proper
context. The *Phenomenology* was the first text of Hegel's split with Schelling,
and its central concept of spirit is crucial to this split and to Hegel's
attempt to render himself independent from Schelling. In his works at the start
of the nineteenth century (which are now understood to be his *early* works),
Schelling emphasises life, organicism, and -- most especially -- *nature* in his
account of the absolute. As Frederick Beiser writes, Schelling got close to
'virtually equating the standpoint of absolute identity with nature itself.'[^9]
However, this led to Schelling taking a quasi-Romantic stance towards the
absolute -- in this view, absolute truth can only be expressed artistically or
poetically. Philosophy must begin, Schelling claims, with an 'utterly
nonobjective principle' which cannot be 'apprehended through concepts.'[^10]
Such a principle, he argues, can be intuited only artistically; 'The work of art
merely reflects to me what is otherwise not reflected by anything, namely that
absolutely identical which has already divided itself even in the self.'[^11]
Schelling's view is that philosophy, being a form of thought and therefore based
in concepts and distinctions, cannot represent nature in its absolute unity;
rather, this unity can only be intuited by artistic means. This is precisely
Hegel's problem with Schelling; we might imagine that, when Hegel refers to
philosophers who 'take what thought has torn asunder and then stir it all
together into a smooth mélange' and who merely 'fabricate the feeling of the
essence' of reality, he is referring not only to the Romantics but also to
Schelling's *Naturphilosophie* with its insistence on an unconscious, pre- (and
indeed anti-) conceptual 'nature'.[^12] In Schellingian *Naturphilosophie*,
Hegel argues, we find that 'spirit has shown itself to be so impoverished that
it seems to yearn for its refreshment only in the meagre feeling of
divinity.'[^13]

The second problem for Hegel is that Schelling's insistence on *unity*, on
nature/absolute as the pure identity of identity, results in an emptied-out
philosophy that has no room for the qualitative difference that
self-consciousness, society, and so on are characterised by. In Schelling's
words, 'Absolute identity *simply is* and is as certain as the proposition A = A
is.'[^14] Considered from the viewpoint of *absolute truth*, therefore, A = A is
the most accurate -- in fact, the *only* -- description of reality; 'there is no
difference, distinction, or multiplicity in that dark night', as Beiser
writes.[^15] This 'night' is precisely what Hegel takes issue with, for how can
an unconscious darkness of pure identity give rise to the 'self-originating,
self-differentiating wealth of shapes' that philosophy is supposed to
comprehend?[^16] Accordingly, Hegel famously regards the absolute of
*Naturphilosophie* as 'the night in which all cows are black': from the
viewpoint of the Schellingian absolute, everything is reduced to sameness, and
nothing beside remains.[^17]

Given that Hegel was something of a Schellingian for some time, it seems that he
regarded *Naturphilosophie* as one of the most sophisticated attempts at
conceiving the absolute as a *substance* (nature, in this case) -- and not as
*subject*, as Fichte had done. Schelling had gone further than Fichte, but
nonetheless arrived at a dead end. Therefore, Hegel's project to overcome
Schelling was to conceive of something 'higher' than nature, which avoids the
two problems outlined above: that is, something which is both accessible to
consciousness and allows for qualitative difference. 'The originality of Hegel's
thought', Hyppolite writes, 'does not lie in its concept of Life but in the
philosophical attempt to conceptualize life by means of a dialectic which
permits "finite determinations" to be engulfed in [but not erased by] "the
indifferent".'[^18] This conception of life is spirit. Spirit (when fully
actualised through its self-understanding) is absolute reality *aware of itself
as both substance and subject*. Being self-understanding, and thereby
incorporating subjectivity and negativity, it makes sense that spirit is a
notion that serves philosophy better than nature with all its quiet stillness.
But what does it mean to say that spirit is 'higher' than nature?

In an 1802 work on natural law, Hegel claims that nature is merely the
'acutality' -- the manifestation -- of the absolute, while spirit is both the
manifestation *and* the *reflection* of the absolute into itself: 'the recovery
of the universe into itself.'[^19] When something is reflected into itself (that
is, when it becomes capable of understanding itself), it does not become
something entirely different; as such, it would be a mistake to understand
spirit as something *supernatural*, utterly 'beyond' nature. Rather, it is
'higher' than nature insofar as it is more *developed*; it is able to give an
explicit account for itself while nature remains dormant, waiting to be
interpreted by something outside of itself.
