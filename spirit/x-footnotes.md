[^16]: §15 (Miller's translation).
[^17]: §16. Harris (*Hegel's Ladder*, I, 52) suggests that the night of black cows refers to Reinhold and his *Urwahre*. I don't see why this is more plausible than what I have suggested.

[^29]: Aristotle, *Nicomachean Ethics*, 1095b (*Basic Works*, p. 937). Aristotle elsewhere (*Metaphysics* 1029b) claims that this is in fact how all learning operates.
[^30]: The fact that we have already acknowledged this stage earlier in the *Phenomenology* (at the start of the actualisation of self-consciousness) testifies to the non-chronological structure of the book.

[^64]: Christians whose Platonic influence led them to disparage embodiment include Clement of Alexandria, Augustine, and Saint Paul. For the feminist critcism, see Wendy Brown, '"Supposing Truth Were a Woman...": Plato's Subversion of Masculine Discourse', in *Political Theory* (1988, Vol. 16, No. 4), p. 598: '[Plato's] repudiation of bodily, sentient, and sensual experience as ways of knowing ... would seem to land him firmly in masculinist terrain.'
[^65]: *Phaedo* 82e.

[^74]: Kalkavage (*The Logic of Desire*, p. 249) suggests that the 'known' here stands for the absolute insofar as it is known by consciousness, and the 'unknown' stands for the unknown remainder of the absolute.
[^75]: §466.
[^76]: §467.
[^77]: Ibid.
[^78]: Harris, *Hegel's Ladder*, II, p. 214.
[^78.1]: Robert Solomon claims that this original sin should be understood not in the Biblical sense but in the Sartrean sense: 'whatever you choose, the nature of the choice itself guarantees guilt and anxiety' (*In the Spirit of Hegel*, p. 548).
[^79]: §468.
[^80]: Ibid.
[^81]: §469. This, of course, relies on Hegel's questionable assumption that Antigone *does* consider herself to be guilty.
