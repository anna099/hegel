### True Spirit, Ethical Life {#true}

As I have mentioned in my introduction, many of Hegel's contemporaries idolised
ancient Greece. In his own way, Hegel did as well; however, he attributed more
discordance to Greek society than writers like Goethe, Schiller, or Winckelmann
were willing to. In the present chapter ('True Spirit, Ethical Life'), Hegel
first analyses the harmonious dimension of ancient Greece (in the section 'The
Ethical World, the Human and Divine Law, Man and Woman') -- this is the
dimension of Greece that his contemporaries admired. Secondly, however (in the
section entitled 'Ethical Action, Human and Divine Knowing, Guilt and Fate'),
Hegel finds a disruption of this harmony which, he argues, the Greek tragedians
were the first to recognise. In this way, Hegel is not as dogmatic a philhellene
as some of his contemporaries were.

#### The Burial of the Dead {#dead}

Aristotle argues that, in the study of ethics, 'we must begin with things known
to us'.[^29] The 'starting points' of ethical reflection, according to
Aristotle, originate in the habits we acquire in our upbringing; in other words,
to study ethics, one must first have some ethical background on which to
reflect. Ethical substance, which has not yet been raised to the self-awareness
of ethical *actuality*, is that background in the stage of 'ethical life'.
Ethical life (*Sittlichkeit*) is for Hegel the stage in a society's history
where people do not fully acknowledge their participation as constituents of
ethical substance; rather, they simply contemplate it as what is 'there'.[^30]
In this sense, Harris argues, ethical life is akin to unhappy consciousness
insofar as it is not really *self*-consciousness but is instead a mere
'awareness' of some *other* (namely, the ethical substance).[^31]

In other words, the structure of ethical life -- which we call *law* -- appears
to the citizen of ethical life as an immediate *given*. What is essential for
Hegel, however, is that it is a *split* given: spirit 'descends upon us' in two
ways, two kinds of law. Firstly, as a 'natural ethical' phenomenon, it is given
as '**divine law**' into which one is born as a person qua *natural being*: a
law which is manifested in family ties.[^32] Hegel's idea here is that the
natural (that is, biological) relations between family members give rise to
certain ethical obligations and duties that family members owe one another. This
dimension of the law emphasises *individuality*; the family is (for Hegel) a
private community separated from the universality of public life. With her sense
of obligation to her brother, Antigone represents the divine law for Hegel. The
second kind of law concerns this universality: it is the 'familiarly known' law,
the legal system into which one is born as a person qua *citizen*. Hegel calls
this '**human law**'; it is determined and enforced by 'the government', and is
thus represented in Sophocles' play be Creon.[^33]

The divine law of the family and the existence of oneself as a family member is
more immediate than one's status as a citizen. I consciously carry out my
citizenship, and it can be debated and determined by the state (think of
refugees, for example), but on the other hand I *immediately am* in a family,
among 'unblemished heavenly shapes' of 'unprofaned innocence', without any
conscious effort required on my part.[^34] Divine law is intuitive, Hegel
argues, and 'does not lie in the daylight of consciousness.'[^35]

Nonetheless, it has a close relation to the human law of the public sphere; the
relation between the two is crucial for Hegel and, in his view, is the source of
the tension in Greek tragedy. Firstly and most simply, the public sphere
*requires* the private sphere insofar as the latter literally produces the
state's population. Already, this gives rise to a tension which George Steiner
captures:

> Inevitably, the state will seek to absorb this familial sphere into its
> governance and order of values. Yet if it did so completely, it would destroy
> not only the individual but the procreative units from which it draws its
> military-political resources. Thus the state, even in the moment of conflict,
> will 'concede divine honours' to the domestic, ethically private dimension of
> existence.[^35.1]

Secondly, though the family emerges in the domain of nature and the individual,
its *ethical* dimension is concerned with culture and the universal -- because
'the ethical is in itself universal.'[^36] For Hegel, this means that love and
sentiment have no relevance to the family as an ethical structure, because love
is 'natural' and not ethical. Rather, the ethical purpose of the family is not
to love and care for one another, but to allow one's family members to break out
of the family and into culture and the public sphere. Family duty 'consists in
taking the singular individual out of the family, in subjugating his naturalness
and individuality, and thus in leading him towards *virtue*, towards a life
lived in and for the universal.'[^37] As such, Hegel thinks that the function of
the family is to undermine the family; family ties are created so that they can
be left behind.

There is, however, a second duty for the family which is 'positive' rather than
'negative'. The family's positive duty is towards the family member who, 'out of
the long progression of his dispersed existence, is condensed into one completed
shape': that is, the individual who has died.[^38] In performing a proper burial
for the dead, the family resists the deceased's dissolution into nature: by
mourning, the dead individual is reasserted -- 'saved' -- as a universal being.
As Hegel understands it, the Greeks practiced burial rites because they
interpreted human life as always already ethical; natural existence (and natural
relations like those of the family) must be taken as embodying ethical norms.
Burial is the divine law's way of maintaining the spiritual existence of an
individual. But this maintenance can also come from the spiritual realm itself,
the realm of human law and government. As an example, Hegel points out the
frequency of warfare in ancient Greece: Greek war, he claims, was a way of
making men 'feel the power of their lord and master, death', and preventing them
from falling back into their 'mere' natural existence.[^39]

In the domain of both human law (war) and divine law (burial), *death* is the
crucial moment in determining an individual's ethical status. When an individual
dies in vain, or dies without being mourned, their universal (ethical) dimension
is destroyed as they become absorbed by nature; if, however, they die for a
'cause', or their death is properly mourned, then the ethical community
'supplements the abstract natural movement by adding to it the movement of
consciousness, by *interrupting nature's work*, and by wresting the
blood-relation away from destruction.'[^40]

#### Women and Men {#women}

Following this, Hegel turns back to family relations and their spiritual
significance -- or, indeed, *in*significance: Hegel's analysis of the family is
particularly cold and dismissive of familial love and care. The specific picture
of a family that he analyses is strictly heterosexual and is oriented almost
totally to the purpose of having children. He starts, therefore, with the
relationship between a husband and wife. This relationship, Hegel claims, is
'only the *representation* and *picture* of spirit'; it does not have
significant spiritual value because the recognition between a husband and wife
is 'natural' (that is, romantic and emotional) rather than ethical. Furthermore,
he argues, the actuality of a marital relationship is external to the
relationship itself -- the relationship is actualised in the child. Hegel even
claims that, with the birth of the child, the purpose of the marital
relationship is achieved and the relationship consequently becomes obsolete
('disappears').[^41] This is presumably what Beauvoir is thinking of when she
repeatedly attributes to Hegel the idea that 'the birth of children is the death
of parents.'[^42]

What about the relationship between parent and child? This also is too impure
for Hegel. Firstly, again, it is 'affected by emotion' (Hegel does not use the
word 'love' to identify this emotion, but instead describes it as the parent's
awareness that the child symbolises the actuality of their marital
relationship); secondly, the child -- despite being the ultimate product of the
parents' relationship -- attains their own being-for-itself, their own autonomy,
and becomes 'an alien actuality' to their parents, undermining any sense of
harmony in the family. Likewise, the child's relationship to their parent is
impure because they are aware of the 'vanishing' of their parents' marital
relationship. This is an awareness that is brought onto the child 'only through
the separation from their origin', that is, through the precise separation that
Freud would also eventually identify as constitutive of human mental life.[^43]

The only immediate family that remains is that of siblings. It is here that
Hegel finally finds a relation 'equal' enough to be *purely* ethical -- though,
as we shall see, this 'equality' can appear as such only from a misogynistic
perspective. Brother and sister 'are the same blood', Hegel claims; 'however, in
them it has reached its state of *rest* and *equilibrium*.'[^44] The brother and
sister are equals, he argues, because neither one of them gave birth to the
other, and neither one has desire for the other; thus, there is no contamination
of 'nature' within their relationship, and it is purely ethical. But why is this
reserved only for the brother-sister relation, and not brother-brother or
sister-sister relations? In fact, Goethe seems to have asked a similar question.
In his March 28, 1827 conversation with Eckermann (on Hinrichs' *The Essence of
Ancient Tragedy*), Goethe remarks: 'I should think that the love of a sister for
her sister would be still purer and more sexless!'[^45] To be sure, if Hegel had
allowed for brothers to be equal, he would have a hard time explaining how
Polynices and Eteocles killed each other. The unsatisfying Hegelian answer to
this puzzle is that the difference between men and women, in his view, is
parallel to the difference between human law and divine law. Indeed, since he
reduces women to the realm of nature and the biological role of reproduction,
and defines divine law in terms of nature, Hegel seems to take the human-divine
(or public-private) distinction as *derived* from the gender binary. So only the
brother-sister relation is purely concerned with ethical matters, because the
brother and sister are not only free from natural contaminations (that is,
parenthood or love) in their relationship, but also because they both have their
own place in the division of the law and need not compete for the same vocation.
'It is nature, not the accident of circumstances or of choice, which assigns one
sex to one law and the other to the other law', Hegel boldly claims.[^46] In the
*Philosophy of Right*, he doubles down on this idea, claiming that a division of
humanity into men and women is rational and necessary on the basis that it
allows the 'vitality' of ethical substantiality to 'achieve a concrete
unity.'[^47] The ethical substance of humanity, he claims, splits itself up into
'the *one*' -- men, who devote themselves to the state and to learning -- and
'the *other*' -- women, who devote themselves to the family and familial
'piety'.[^48] Because of this ethical purity, Hegel sees the sister's duty to
the brother as *absolute*. As Antigone herself says, 'if my husband died, I
could find another. Another man could give me another child. But with my mother
and father buried in Hades no brother could ever come into being from
them.'[^49] Hegel is surely thinking of these lines when he writes that 'the
loss of a brother is thus irreplaceable to the sister, and her duty towards him
is the highest.'[^50]

At this point, and because of the general incoherence of his account of gender,
some commentators have suggested that Hegel was projecting his own feelings
about his sister into his own work.[^51] Christiane Hegel was intelligent,
politically engaged (she smuggled letters to a political prisoner) and read
enthusiastically (along with writing poetry); she and her brother were,
initially, very close. In 1815, Christiane came to stay with Hegel and his wife
Marie after the birth of their son; however, following the visit she developed a
hatred for Marie and a disappointment in Hegel. Eventually, she became ill -- a
case of 'hysteria', according to Hegel -- and spent time in a sanatorium.[^52]

Whatever Hegel's motivations, he views this organisation of society as a
significant turning point (and starting point). In this ancient world -- 'the
Eden of the spirit', as Harris calls it -- everyone has their place, and the
individual human nature of *Reason* has given way to the self-conscious ethical
community of *Spirit*.[^53] In §460, Hegel recounts the various deadlocks of
reason and describes how they are overcome in harmonious ethical life. That
which the coldness of observing reason failed to find in a dead bone, 'in which
the self would have had no share', is found here as 'a set of given mores'. The
virtue-obsessed individualist is relegated to the past, and now the individual
finds pleasure situated in their family life, which is itself situated in the
state. In other words, Hegel says, we have reached 'the knowing of the *law of
the heart* as the law of all hearts' -- or, ethos [*Sitte*].

Greek society is thus 'a peaceful equilibrium', Hegel claims.[^54] Each part --
each family and the individuals within it -- experiences satisfaction *because*
it is a part of the whole. The equilibrium of the whole, however, persists in a
'living' condition only through the continuous mission it poses against
injustice. The stability of society is maintained in the face of 'an inequality
which is then brought back to equality by *justice*.' For Hegel there are two
kinds of justice, corresponding to the two kinds of law in society. Human law
establishes justice by means of the government, which subsumes the
'self-sufficiency' of society's estates under a governing universal, brining
back 'singular individuals who are moving out of and away from [society's]
equilibrium.' Divine justice is carried out by the individual, sovereign of the
household, through means of *death*: in the face of natural evil which 'just
happens' (since, according to Hegel, injustice against an individual in this
harmonious state is never brought about by the polity, but always by nature), an
individual transforms a '*mere event*' into a '*work*' by taking being and
finality -- that is, death -- into their own hands. Through these forms of
justice, and through the permeation of the human and divine spheres of life into
one another, the Greeks inhabit 'a world unpolluted by any division.'[^55] Hegel
describes the logical structure of this social stability as follows:

> Its movement consists in one of its powers peacefully coming to be the other
> so that each preserves and brings forth the other. To be sure, we see it
> dividing itself into two essences and their actuality, but their opposition is
> instead the proof of one through the other, and their mediating middle and
> element is the immediate permeation of each by the other in which they
> immediately come into contact with each other as actual powers.[^56]

If this sounds idyllic, we have to be patient: as always in the *Phenomenology*,
each beginning is a claim to *certainty* which is not yet *truth*. This section
on 'the ethical world' is only an immediate attempt at grasping justice in
society, and in the following section we will see -- through the tension of
*Antigone* -- how this grasp is illusory, and how the organisation of Greek life
gives rise to fatal tensions. However, there are firstly some issues in Hegel's
thought so far that ought to be addressed.

#### Myths {#myths}

The *Phenomenology* is concerned with change. Though it is not a history book
(as established above), it is nonetheless focused on how certain structures --
of thought, self-consciousness, society -- can eclipse and give way to something
new; thus, the stability of Greek life in the current chapter will eventually
crumble. However, some of Hegel's views on women and the family in this chapter,
despite clearly being conditioned by his own position in history, are seemingly
taken as natural and necessary. Seyla Benhabib has pointed out that, although
Hegel acknowledges that gendered differences are culturally determined (in his
readings of Chinese concubinage and of Herodotus on Egypt), he nonetheless takes
the restriction of women to the private sphere (or the sphere of 'divine law')
as inherently rational and necessary.[^57] In the passage quoted above from the
*Philosophy of Rights*, Hegel describes the division between men and women as
having *ethical* significance derived from a *natural* basis. And is 'the
family' not itself socially constructed? Every human has biological ties (no
matter how indirect) with every other human; why is it just the parents,
siblings, and children that are considered 'the family'? Doesn't a (historically
contingent) state, with whatever laws it may or may not have regarding marriage,
reproduction, abortion, and so on, have a role in determining what familial
relations are possible (or, indeed, enforced)?[^58] Moreover, when Hegel invokes
the Roman 'Penates' (household gods) in describing the social place of 'the
feminine', is he not himself ascribing these rigid gender norms to societies
beyond Greece?[^59]

Hegel is sexist here in a particularly pernicious way: by reducing women's
subordinated place in society to a natural necessity, he snatches them out of
history (and therefore spirit, as well). As Benhabib puts it, 'Hegel's Antigone
is one without a future; her tragedy is also the grave of a utopian,
revolutionary thinking about gender relations. Hegel, it turns out, is *women's
gravedigger*.'[^60]

Furthermore, there is a possibility that Hegel's insistence on distinguishing
the public and private spheres actually undermines the possibility of ethical
life. Beauvoir suggests that, in restricting ethics (and the universal) to
public life, and rendering the private sphere as the domain of natural instinct
('a contingent region where morality no longer applies'), Hegel attempts a
justification for 'private' misogyny and leaves room for the hypocrisy of men's
lives.[^61] When a man has responsibilities only outside of the home, he is free
to live a double life and treat his wife and family however he pleases:

> His wife is often astonished -- like Thérèse Desqueyroux [a François Mauriac
> character] -- at the contrast between the high tone of his comments, his
> public conduct, and 'his persevering inventions in the dark.' He preaches
> repopulation: he is cunning in having no more children than is convenient for
> him. He exalts chaste and faithful wives: but he invites his neighbour's wife
> to commit adultery. We have seen the hypocrisy with which men decree that
> abortion is criminal when every year in France a million women are put by men
> in a situation to have an abortion.[^62]

Beauvoir's point is that, in the kind of society Hegel is describing in this
chapter, the total lack of universality in the familial (or divine) context
gives men a space in which to shrug off ethical commitments entirely. (Think of
Rousseau who, despite having a lot to say regarding how one should raise
children, gave all of his five children away to the poor conditions of a
founding home.) If an ethical commitment can be simply forgotten in a certain
circumstance, is it a commitment at all?

Lastly, a different kind of criticism: in describing ancient society, Hegel
seems to erroneously attribute to the Greeks a kind of somatophobia: an attitude
of fear, rejection, or dismissal of the body and bodily existence. He describes
burial rites as a practice that 'elevate' the individual 'above his
*confinement* within the natural polity', for instance.[^63] As I have
explained, part of Hegel's overall project is to foreground a dimension of
existence -- 'spirit' -- that is higher than nature. This is not necessarily
mistaken, but in this particular moment of his project, he sees the Greeks as
having a commitment to spirit that makes them *reject* nature, to regard it as
belonging to the inferior and merely particular realm of the private sphere.
Indeed, Hegel is not the first to describe the Greeks in this way. Plato has
been both praised and criticised for an apparent somatophobia (by the Christian
and feminist philosophical traditions, respectively).[^64] Indeed, there are
moments in Plato where this interpretation seems plausible, particularly in the
*Phaedo*: when Socrates describes the soul in the body as a prisoner in the
cage, this is comparable to Hegel's picture of the Greeks as 'confined' within
nature.[^65] But at the same time, Plato identifies *appetite* -- something that
necessarily relates to embodiment -- as the largest aspect of the soul, and
claims in multiple places (*Charmides* 156e, *Republic* 591c-d) that the soul
cannot be healed or cared for without the body also being tended to, and vice
versa.[^66] While Hegel portrays ancient Greek life as concerned exclusively
with a disembodied universal *ethos*, more informed accounts (such as those by
Pierre Hadot and Michel Foucault) show that the ancients understood ethics, and
even notions as abstract as 'soul', in terms of embodied *care* for oneself.
Foucault frequently refers to the Greek word χρῆσις (*khrêsis*), which refers to
a kind of behaviour: of use, care-taking, instrumental employment, and so on.
Greek philosophy and culture, he argues, always foregrounds some relation of
care -- whether it is a medical-therapeutic one (in Plato, Epicurus, the Stoics,
and Philo of Alexandria) or one of athletic or gymnastic training (in Plato, the
Stoics, and later in various Roman thinkers) -- and it is in terms of this care
that *both* the body and the soul, embodied and ethical existence, are
understood.[^67] This is recognisably different from Hegel's Greek citizens, who
are desperate to leave the limits of the body behind and dwell with the
universal -- just as long as they are men.

Hegel's picture of ethical life in the ancient world is thus misleading in
several ways. The consolation for us, however, is that the next section in the
*Phenomenology* shows this ethical life to be constitutively unstable.
