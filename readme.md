I'm using `pandoc` so that I can write my notes in Markdown and have them
converted to HTML. However, some versions of pandoc don't format ‘smart quotes’
in the outputted HTML, which I want; as such, I'm using an open source program
called `quoter` ([source](https://dwheeler.com/quoter/)) to re-format pandoc's
HTML.
