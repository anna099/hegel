[^0]: Recall Foucault's famous remark in 'The Discourse on Language' (*The
  Archaeology of Knowledge*, translated by A. M. Sheridan Smith (New York:
  Pantheon Books, 1972), p. 235):

    > Our age, whether through logic or epistemology, whether through Marx or
    > through Nietzsche, is attempting to flee Hegel .... We have to determine
    > the extent to which our anti-Hegelianism is possibly one of his tricks
    > directed against us, at the end of which he stands, motionless, waiting
    > for us.
