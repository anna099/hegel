<p id="cite-note">(A minor note on citations: I have made an effort to cite
every quotation or paraphrasing in my writing; however, I quote from Hegel's
*Phenomenology* so extensively that, when my quotations are only a few words
long, or when the context makes the origin of the quotation obvious, I have
sometimes omitted the citation.)</p>
