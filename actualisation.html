<h3 id="the-actualisation-of-rational-self-consciousness">The Actualisation of Rational Self-Consciousness</h3>
<p>Consciousness, who serves as the ‘protagonist’ of the <em>Phenomenology</em>, is still an idealist at this stage. That is, we are still examining the increasingly sophisticated ways in which rational consciousness tries to see reason in the world. If we recall Robert Solomon’s suggestion<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> that Hegel’s book consists of <em>two</em> phenomenologies – one of theory and one of practice – then we can see how the journey of observing reason was a recapitulation (albeit in a more developed manner) of the development in the <em>Consciousness</em> chapter.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> But now we are returning to the phenomenology of <em>practice</em> that begun in the <em>Self-Consciousness</em> chapter; thus, the Reason that self-consciousness embodies no longer wants simply to <em>find</em> rationality in the world, but to <em>actualise</em> it: ‘to engender itself by its own activity.’<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Through this process, self-consciousness will work towards experiencing what <strong>spirit</strong> really is: namely, ‘The <em>I</em> that is <em>we</em> and the <em>we</em> that is <em>I</em>.’<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Self-consciousness’s <em>immediate</em> certainty of being all reality was shattered by the emptiness of phrenology. The subject of this <em>Actualisation</em> chapter – that is, the consciousness whose development we (the phenomenologists) are observing – is the <em>free</em>, embodied self-consciousness that the phrenologist unintentionally discovered. The subject (or ‘rational self-consciousness’) who actualises herself in this chapter is precisely that which the judgment ‘the self is a thing’ <em>failed</em> to consider. All of the rigidity and dead matter that the phrenologist identified <em>as</em> individual spirit now serves as <em>negative space</em>, drawing an outline around the living, <em>active</em> spirit of the individual. Where the ‘observer’ character of the previous chapter was concerned with observation, we are now concerned with <em>action</em>; where the observer was concerned with the natural world, we are concerned with the <strong>ethical</strong> world.</p>
<h4 id="story">The Story of Subjectivity (So Far)</h4>
<p>Since the actualisation of the subject (that is, the ‘rational self-consciousness’) in this chapter parallels the development in the <em>Self-Consciousness</em> chapter – and since we have covered a long journey since that chapter – it might help to give a very brief summary of the latter.</p>
<p>Self-consciousness begins as the confident declaration that ‘<em>I am myself</em>’ is the most immediate certainty. In trying to assert itself, self-consciousness went about <em>negating</em> other things, destroying or consuming them in acts of desire.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> However, this cannot bring about long-term self-assertion and satisfaction, because defining oneself against some non-I ‘thing’ requires the thing to exist continuously – and the negation of it prevents this from happening. Self-consciousness realises that only a real Other – that is, <em>another self-consciousness</em> – can offer the <strong>recognition</strong> that self-assertion requires, because the Other has the capacity to negate themselves, and to ‘offer themselves up’ to self-consciousness.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This is what leads to the famous relationship of master and slave (or ‘mastery and servitude’); after trying to defeat an Other in a fight for self-assertion (a ‘trial by death’), self-consciousness becomes too fearful of dying, and wagers that it is better to be enslaved to the Other than dead entirely.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>As the relationship between master and slave plays out, the master eventually realises that the denigrated slave is no longer a source of worthy recognition. Meanwhile, the slave comes to find a new form of self-awareness through their work: seeing themselves reflected in their work, the slave’s self-consciousness progresses beyond mere desire.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This autonomy allows the slave, like Epictetus, to become a stoic who finds freedom and self-assurance in <em>thinking</em> rather than in the pain of enslaved labouring.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> However, the stoic becomes literally lost in thought, tangled up in concepts without content, and is thereby led towards <em>skepticism</em> which takes this abandonment of the world and makes it <em>conscious</em>. The skeptical self-consciousness hopes to find its freedom in <em>ataraxia</em>, an inner stability that comes from withholding all judgments about the world.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> However, the skeptic quickly gets dizzy in its constant contrarianism; and, more significantly, its <em>adherence</em> to nullifying everything is never itself nullified! In this regard, skepticism manifests itself as a self-contradictory self-consciousness, caught up in a performative contradiction.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Since the chaos of skepticism makes <em>ataraxia</em> a seemingly unreachable goal, self-consciousness becomes <em>unhappy</em> and posits the ‘unchangeable’ – the ataraxic, rational universal reality beyond appearances – as something <em>beyond</em> self-consciousness – something <em>divine</em>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Now, like the master over the slave, the unhappy consciousness denigrates their contingent (i.e. bodily) existence with contempt; this is the first time in the <em>Phenomenology</em> that ‘absolute negativity’ is embodied. The unhappy consciousness looks for the divine unchangeable on Earth, but finds that the planet is nothing but the grave of God.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The only hope that remains is found in the counsel of the ‘priest’: a figure who <em>mediates</em> between the unhappy self-consciousness and the unchangeable God.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> This mediation is what concludes the <em>Self-Consciousness</em> chapter and marks the birth of <em>Reason</em>.</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>Peter Kalkavage (<em>The Logic of Desire</em>, p. 486) suggests that the parallel between <em>Consciousness</em> and <em>Observing Reason</em> can be understood as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Observing reason in its first phase resembles sense-certainty in its attentiveness to the Thises of organic nature. In its second phase, it posits the rational self as a Thing with many properties – properties for which reason finds laws. And in its third phase, it repeats the understanding in positing a distinction between essence (invisible selfhood) and appearance (outward signs).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More concisely, Inwood (‘Commentary’, p. 429) puts forward this suggestion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Observing reason corresponds to sensory certainty in description, to perception in the classification of organisms, and to understanding in its search for laws.</p>
