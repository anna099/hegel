<h3 id="the-actualisation-of-rational-self-consciousness">The Actualisation of Rational Self-Consciousness</h3>
<p>Consciousness, who serves as the ‘protagonist’ of the <em>Phenomenology</em>, is still an idealist at this stage. That is, we are still examining the increasingly sophisticated ways in which rational consciousness tries to see reason in the world. If we recall Robert Solomon’s suggestion<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> that Hegel’s book consists of <em>two</em> phenomenologies – one of theory and one of practice – then we can see how the journey of observing reason was a recapitulation (albeit in a more developed manner) of the development in the <em>Consciousness</em> chapter.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> But now we are returning to the phenomenology of <em>practice</em> that begun in the <em>Self-Consciousness</em> chapter; thus, the Reason that self-consciousness embodies no longer wants simply to <em>find</em> rationality in the world, but to <em>actualise</em> it: ‘to engender itself by its own activity.’<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Through this process, self-consciousness will work towards experiencing what <strong>spirit</strong> really is: namely, ‘The <em>I</em> that is <em>we</em> and the <em>we</em> that is <em>I</em>.’<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Self-consciousness’s <em>immediate</em> certainty of being all reality was shattered by the emptiness of phrenology. The subject of this <em>Actualisation</em> chapter – that is, the consciousness whose development we (the phenomenologists) are observing – is the <em>free</em>, embodied self-consciousness that the phrenologist unintentionally discovered. The subject (or ‘rational self-consciousness’) who actualises herself in this chapter is precisely that which the judgment ‘the self is a thing’ <em>failed</em> to consider. All of the rigidity and dead matter that the phrenologist identified <em>as</em> individual spirit now serves as <em>negative space</em>, drawing an outline around the living, <em>active</em> spirit of the individual. Where the ‘observer’ character of the previous chapter was concerned with observation, we are now concerned with <em>action</em>; where the observer was concerned with the natural world, we are concerned with the <strong>ethical</strong> world.</p>
<p>This chapter is the beginning of the individual’s genuine <em>action</em>, since the genuine freedom that action requires was not to be found in <em>Self-Consciousness</em> prior to <em>Reason</em>. The freedom of the stoic and skeptic was cut off from the actual world, and the unhappy consciousness ended up giving up their freedom in following the priest’s instruction. A genuinely free individual (who is also rational and embodied) is on the scene only now, as the unintentional consequence of observational reason’s failure. Now, this is not to say that contemplation and desire play no role in human activity from this point forth; rather, they are <em>incorporated</em> into the subject’s more sophisticated activity: that is, <em>action</em> and <em>actualisation</em>.</p>
<h4 id="story">The Story of Subjectivity (So Far)</h4>
<p>Since the actualisation of the subject (that is, the ‘rational self-consciousness’) in this chapter parallels the development in the <em>Self-Consciousness</em> chapter – and since we have covered a long journey since that chapter – it might help to give a very brief summary of the latter.</p>
<p>Self-consciousness begins as the confident declaration that ‘<em>I am myself</em>’ is the most immediate certainty. In trying to assert itself, self-consciousness went about <em>negating</em> other things, destroying or consuming them in acts of desire.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> However, this cannot bring about long-term self-assertion and satisfaction, because defining oneself against some non-I ‘thing’ requires the thing to exist continuously – and the negation of it prevents this from happening. Self-consciousness realises that only a real Other – that is, <em>another self-consciousness</em> – can offer the <strong>recognition</strong> that self-assertion requires, because the Other has the capacity to negate themselves, and to ‘offer themselves up’ to self-consciousness.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This is what leads to the famous relationship of master and slave (or ‘mastery and servitude’); after trying to defeat an Other in a fight for self-assertion (a ‘trial by death’), self-consciousness becomes too fearful of dying, and wagers that it is better to be enslaved to the Other than dead entirely.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>As the relationship between master and slave plays out, the master eventually realises that the denigrated slave is no longer a source of worthy recognition. Meanwhile, the slave comes to find a new form of self-awareness through their work: seeing themselves reflected in their work, the slave’s self-consciousness progresses beyond mere desire.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This autonomy allows the slave, like Epictetus, to become a stoic who finds freedom and self-assurance in <em>thinking</em> rather than in the pain of enslaved labouring.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> However, the stoic becomes literally lost in thought, tangled up in concepts without content, and is thereby led towards <em>skepticism</em> which takes this abandonment of the world and makes it <em>conscious</em>. The skeptical self-consciousness hopes to find its freedom in <em>ataraxia</em>, an inner stability that comes from withholding all judgments about the world.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> However, the skeptic quickly gets dizzy in its constant contrarianism; and, more significantly, its <em>adherence</em> to nullifying everything is never itself nullified! In this regard, skepticism manifests itself as a self-contradictory self-consciousness, caught up in a performative contradiction.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Since the chaos of skepticism makes <em>ataraxia</em> a seemingly unreachable goal, self-consciousness becomes <em>unhappy</em> and posits the ‘unchangeable’ – the ataraxic, rational universal reality beyond appearances – as something <em>beyond</em> self-consciousness – something <em>divine</em>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Now, like the master over the slave, the unhappy consciousness denigrates their contingent (i.e. bodily) existence with contempt; this is the first time in the <em>Phenomenology</em> that ‘absolute negativity’ is embodied. The unhappy consciousness looks for the divine unchangeable on Earth, but finds that the planet is nothing but the grave of God.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The only hope that remains is for the subject to surrender their freedom to the counsel and instruction of the ‘priest’: a figure who <em>mediates</em> between the unhappy self-consciousness and the unchangeable God.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> This mediation is what concludes the <em>Self-Consciousness</em> chapter and marks the birth of <em>Reason</em> – the Reason that, failing to find itself reflected in the world through mere <em>observation</em>, now turns to action.</p>
<h4 id="ethos">Ethos</h4>
<p>The launch into active reason is a little bewildering, as the subject is no longer a lonely adventurer who occasionally interacts with an Other in the form of a master, a priest, or a criminal; now, ‘the <em>realm of ethical life</em> opens itself up.’<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> This is a realm of not just a single Other, but an entire community (a ‘<em>polis</em>’, perhaps): namely, a society of ‘individuals in their self-sufficient <em>actuality</em>’, possessing reason and an awareness of other individuals around them. ‘Ethical life’ is <em>Sittlichkeit</em>, a central term in Hegel’s philosophy, deriving from <em>Sitte</em> which can be translated into the Greek term <em>ethos</em>. Ethical life, for Hegel, can be understood simply as the ‘<strong>spiritual</strong> <em>unity</em> of the essence of those individuals’ that make up a society.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Kalkavage points out that while, in the <em>Self-Consciousness</em> chapter, ‘the self waged war on thinghood’, and in the <em>Reason</em> chapter, thinghood and objectivity was ‘something to be desired in a positive sense’, with the birth of the free individual, the ‘subject now desires <em>inter</em>-subjectivity’ – that is, a <strong>recognition</strong> of subjectivity in its objects (namely, other individuals).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Hegel describes this inter-subjectivity in some detail, and shows that it has a co-constitutive relationship with ethical life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the life of a people, the concept of the actualization of self-conscious reason has in fact its consummate reality, namely, where in the self-sufficiency of the <em>other</em>, each intuits its complete <em>unity</em> with the other, or where I have for an object this free <em>thinghood</em> of an other, which is the negative of myself and which I simply find before me, as <em>my</em> being-for-<em>myself</em>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Hegel means in this remark is that, in ethical life, multiple individuals find <em>unity in difference</em>. I can recognise an Other as an individual in her own right, because we are both living in the same ethos. In this regard, Hegel suggests, we can understand ethical life metaphorically as ‘light [that] shatters into stars as innumerable luminous points, each shining by its own light’.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Or, as Inwood suggests, the relationship between ethical life and individuals is comparable to the difference, in Saussure’s linguistics, between <em>langue</em> (language as such, the rules and conventions of language) and <em>parole</em> (the concrete linguistic utterances of an individual). There is no <em>langue</em> without <em>parole</em>, and vice versa; in the same way, there are no free individuals outside of ethical life, and no ethical life without free individuals.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> More specifically, ethical life as the ‘universal substance’ of society is identified by Hegel as the ‘doing’ of the individuals, ‘the work which is brought forth by themselves’; thus, he recognises that the <em>actualisation</em> of the individual is essential to the cultivation of ethos.</p>
<p>The interdependence of the individual and the totality of ethical life runs as deep as the most basic, singular functions of the human being, Hegel argues. The individual’s ‘commonest functions’, he writes, are social not only in their <em>form</em> but also in their content: ‘the individual’s <em>labor</em> for his needs is a satisfaction of the needs of others as much as it is of his own needs, and the satisfaction of his own needs is something he attains only through the labor of others.’<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Now, Aristotle had also recognised the intrinsic link between basic human functions and the functions of society: early in his <em>Politics</em>, he suggests that complex social institutions (like the State) emerge from the simplest forms of human interactions which themselves are based on humanity’s ‘natural desire to leave behind an image of themselves’.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> So, for Aristotle, ethical life can in some way be traced back to the reproductive desire of individuals. Hegel and Aristotle are making very similar points here: that is, that human functions become <em>social</em> functions, because the maintenance of life and self-actualisation involves help from others, communication with others, a division of labour, and so on. To put it in more explicitly Hegelian terms: in ethical life, my being-for-another is identical to my being-for-self. This unity, Hegel says, ‘speaks its <em>universal language</em> within the ethos and laws of a people.’</p>
<p>Already, therefore, we have reached a more sophisticated understanding of the individual and her relation to society. Recall that, for the psychologist, the individual and the customs of their society were assumed to be two distinct poles; no relation could be found between them, since the individual’s freedom undermined any possible attachment to social custom. Now, however, we have realised that the individual’s freedom is <em>part</em> of their immersion in the ethos of society, the two poles of the observational psychologist are, as Harris says, ‘brought together in a universal concept that has a higher level of comprehension.’<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In ethical life, the substance of the individual <em>and</em> of the community are determined by individual activity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a free people reason is in truth actualized. It is a current living spirit not only in that the individual finds his <em>destiny</em> [<em>Bestimmung</em>], that is, his universal and singular essence, expressed and found present as thinghood, but also that he himself is this essence and that he has also achieved his destiny.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, this seems very triumphant. The individual has achieved their destiny; and every individual has done so by collaborating socially! This sounds an awful lot like <em>spirit</em>; that is, ‘the I that is we and the we that is I’. But we are not yet at spirit – we see this most plainly in the fact that we are still in the <em>Reason</em> chapter. So, what is there that lies in our way, between the self-actualising individual and spirit? Hegel makes two suggestions: first, there is the possibility that the individual <em>loses</em> her destiny and her attachment to ethical life: self-consciousness ‘lives surrounded by that destiny, then … leaves it behind’; alternatively, and more simply, it may be the case that the individual ‘has not yet achieved its destiny’.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In either state of affairs, it can be said that the individual ‘is <em>spirit</em>’ only according to the <em>concept</em> of spirit, and not in truth – that is, she ‘is <em>spirit</em> only <em>immediately</em>.’</p>
<p>It is possible for individuals to withdraw from ethical life (and, vice versa, for ethical life to withdraw from them), Hegel argues, because the ‘universal spirit’ of ethical life is a ‘restricted ethical substance’ when it is not cognised by the individuals that make it up.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> What Hegel means by this is that, when the <em>ethos</em> of a society is not reflected on, it is only <em>in itself</em>, and is therefore limited in its scope. Only ‘in that lofty moment, namely, the <em>consciousness about</em> [ethical life’s] <em>essence</em>’, does it do away with this limitation. Prior to this reflective awareness, individuals live in ethical life only <em>immediately</em>, just accepting the norms and customs around them. For ‘ethical substance’ to exist <em>in- and for-itself</em>, there must be some kind of critical reflection on it; for instance, Harris points to Ancient Greek Sophism, which was developed by individuals who experienced <em>multiple</em> cultures and ethical contexts and were then able to reflect critically upon their own. Harris points out that, crucially,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this presence of “critical” Reason was not fatal to the Ethical Substance; quite the contrary, in fact, if we think that the existence of the Sophists was essential to the appearance of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Hegel adds that even though a critical reflection allows ethical life to develop and become for-itself, the individual (or, we might say, individual<em>ist</em>) who <em>enacts</em> this reflection will have their ‘<em>immediate</em> unity with spirit’ – their ‘trust’ – dissolved.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> This dissolution can be seen in the trial of Socrates, or in the lives of ‘the heroes of Romanticism’, as Hyppolite suggests.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn2"><p>Peter Kalkavage (<em>The Logic of Desire</em>, p. 486) suggests that the parallel between <em>Consciousness</em> and <em>Observing Reason</em> can be understood as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Observing reason in its first phase resembles sense-certainty in its attentiveness to the Thises of organic nature. In its second phase, it posits the rational self as a Thing with many properties – properties for which reason finds laws. And in its third phase, it repeats the understanding in positing a distinction between essence (invisible selfhood) and appearance (outward signs).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More concisely, Inwood (‘Commentary’, p. 429) puts forward this suggestion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Observing reason corresponds to sensory certainty in description, to perception in the classification of organisms, and to understanding in its search for laws.</p>
