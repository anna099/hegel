## Reason

### Observation of Self-Consciousness
#### (in its Purity and in its Relation to External Actuality:<br>Logical and Psychological Laws) {.subtitle}

It should be no surprise by now that this chapter, too, will end in failure.
Consciousness presses on throughout the *Phenomenology*, following Samuel
Beckett's words -- 'Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again.
Fail better.' -- until it reconciles itself with *that which makes it move* in
the first place.[^1] When consciousness takes on the role of *observing reason*,
it turns towards the world to try and proves its instinctive idea that the world
is rational; in other words, and as we have already seen many times, reason
wants to observe the world and find itself looking back. In its observation of
inorganic and organic nature, however, reason was only able to grasp its object
as static and dead, reduced to a kind of hollow mechanism.

Rational consciousness's subsequent turn to *itself*, which Hegel explores in
this section, is not just another analysis of the formation and transformation
of self-consciousness (as we had in the chapter *named* after
self-consciousness); rather, it is the moment where rational self-consciousness
becomes an object for itself, in just the same way that *nature* was previously.
The observer is going to try and find 'logical and psychological laws' that
govern conscious thought. Consciousness *observes* its own thought, and then
asks: by what standards or rules is this thinking carried out? Consequently,
this part of the Reason chapter is Hegel's analysis of **logic**; and,
interestingly, it is only a few pages long.

In the search for logical and psychological laws, the observer first finds
within herself 'the *laws of thought*' -- what we might identify as the law of
non-contradiction, the law of identity, and so on.[^2] Now, since pure thinking
*as such* is an 'abstract movement', concerned with universal ideas rather than
particular objects, these laws of thought are 'supposed' by the observer 'not to
be the *entire* truth but nonetheless to be *formally* true.'[^3] For instance,
the law of identity on its own (*x = x*) expresses only the abstract form of an
arbitrary possible object, rather than an object present in reality. This is a
common critical idea regarding logic: it is too formal, too abstract, to tell us
anything about the world. However, Hegel's critique is that the *opposite* is
true. The observer is mistaken; logic is not devoid of *content*, but in fact
devoid of *form*. Insofar as the logical 'laws of thought' are derived from mere
observation of a particular creature (that is, the observer themselves), they
take the form of 'a *found* content', or 'a given'.[^4] The observer has
mistaken the same mistake that was made in the observation of nature: the very
act of observation, and the attempt to find *law*, has taken the inherent
dynamism and movement out of the world, rendering it as something wholly static.
As Hegel writes,

> In the course of being studied, [the 'laws of thought'] are torn away from the
> context of movement and are arranged as singulars ... these determinatenesses
> are not lacking in content since they in fact have a determinate content. What
> they lack is form, which is their essence.[^5]

As it stands, the laws of thought aren't actually 'universal' rules of the forms
of thinking (and of thinkable things); in fact, they are mere contingent
observations of 'the content of thought'. Thus, 'observation is not knowing
itself', and it 'inverts its nature into the shape of *being*, i.e., it grasps
its negativity' -- that is, its *movement* -- 'only as *laws* of being.' Yet
again, the shortcoming of observing reason is that it finds *doing* in the
world, and falsely renders it as static *being*.

Consequently, the observer must observe self-consciousness as an *active*
process, if it is to find the laws that govern it. Hegel actually suggests that,
in taking this step forward (i.e. towards the acknowledgment of
self-consciousness as *active*), the observer is 'guided by the very nature of
the matter which is at issue', though she does not yet comprehend 'the way this
all hangs together.'[^6] Though it's not entirely clear, this might be a hint
that the observer is getting closer to realising *its own role* in that which it
is observing. Either way, the observation of self-consciousness as *active*
marks a decisive move away from *logic* and towards **psychology**, which Hegel
defines as follows:

> Psychology contains the class of laws according to which spirit conducts
> itself in various ways towards the various modes of its actuality as an *only
> found otherness*.[^7]
