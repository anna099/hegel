#### Physiognomy {#physio}

Having found no place for law in the individual's free mind, our observer gives
up her short-lived career in psychology and turns to the more visible aspect of
human existence: the 'distinctive determinateness' of individuality, the
'rigidly fixed being' of an individual's actuality: that is, the **body**.[^16]
This move seems plausible: it seems intuitive that the body is closer to an
individual's 'inner life' than the aforementioned actualities of spirit are.
Moreover, while logic studied only the *purely universal* elements of human
consciousness (that is, the laws of thinking), and psychology studied the
*particular* shape of the human in its environment, physiognomy and phrenology
take a slightly more sophisticated route by understanding the individual *as an
individual*; that is, as an incorporation of both previous logical moments,
universal and particular: the individual that the observer now examines is the
result of an *outer* expression of an *inner* essence.

In ancient times, Plato had supposed that the human body was designed by the
gods to house the soul, and that every basic function of the body could be
traced back to this purpose.[^17] In Hegel's own era, scientists like Johann
Kaspar Lavater revived the discipline of 'physiognomy', claiming that one could
discern somebody's character and personality based on an observation of their
physical appearance (especially, in the case of Lavater, of the face). In this
final part of *Observing Reason*, Hegel will criticise physiognomy and
phrenology as forms of pseudoscience; their shortcomings, we will see, are
somewhat similar to those of psychology.

For the physiognomist, Hegel says, the body is an outer **sign** of an
individual's inner life. Indeed, since we cannot literally peer inside the mind
of a person, we rely on the body and its activity (facial expressions, speech,
and so on) as it 'makes known what he [the person] *is*, in the sense of putting
his original nature into practice.' With this idea, we arrive at another
formulation of the 'outer-expressing-inner' motif that appears so often in the
*Phenomenology*. The body is understood as a kind of 'record', signifying what
the individual *has done*: it is the congealed history of an individual's
activity.[^18] According to some, this idea is a classic element of
Enlightenment thinking; as Adorno and Horkheimer wrote, 'animism spiritualized
the object, whereas industrialism [of the modern, 'enlightened' era] objectifies
the spirits of men.'[^19] Quite quickly, however, Hegel takes apart this
ambitious idea that the appearance of our bodies is a tell-tale sign of what
lies within us. First of all, he points out that the process of human *acting*
isn't rightly understood as something 'inner' eventually manifesting as
something 'outer'; rather, 'the inner ... is the *activity* itself.'[^20] An
individual's activity is nothing at all until it is acted out, so we have no
basis for supposing some prior, 'inner' cause of the activity. Alasdair
MacIntyre puts this criticism in the following way:

> When we see someone with a sad expression on his face, we do not infer to an
> inner sadness he feels on the basis of an observed correlation between such a
> physical arrangement of the facial features and inner states of sadness. We
> read or interpret the expression as one of sadness in the light of the
> conventions in our culture for interpreting facial expressions.[^21]

MacIntyre's reference to our *interpretation* ('in light of conventions') of
bodily expression leads to Hegel's second point; namely, that when our activity
becomes visible to others through our facial expression, body language, and so
on, it becomes 'an actuality cut off from the individual.'[^22] When individual
activity is 'publicly' manifested, the actor has no authority on what this
activity 'means', signifies, and so on. In Hegel's words, 'language and labor'
-- that is, all the visible activities of an individual -- 'are expressions in
which the individual on his own no longer retains and possesses himself; rather,
he lets the inner move wholly outside of him and he thus *abandons it to the
other*.'[^23] Imagine that I mean to act in a certain way, and that my activity
doesn't deceive me: my 'meaning' is interpreted by an Other accurately. Now, as
previously stated, there is really no difference between my 'meaning' and the
activity itself; consequently, 'no opposition remains between [the activity] and
the inner', and there is thus no 'relation' within which the observer can find a
law.

Finding no stable law within the *activity* of a body, the physiognomist can
still turn to the *features* of a body to try and access an individual's inner
life. Rather than the words that someone's voice speaks, or the gestures that
their hands perform, the physiognomist can instead look to the '*tone* and
*range* of the voice', and 'the *simple lines of the hand*', taking these
features to be signs of something inner.[^24] There are two advantages to this
strategy: first of all, like the signs (that is, 'signifiers') in language,
these features are stable and consistent, especially when compared to the
fluidity of body language and vocal expression. Secondly, in Hegel's words, 'the
*organ* of activity is just as *much* a *being* as it is a doing': that is to
say, body parts like the mouth and hand are so central and essential to an
individual's activity that, in a sense, what they *are* is simply what the
individual *does*. It is 'the hand by which a person brings himself to
appearance and actualizes himself', Hegel writes: 'It is the ensouled artisan of
his fortune.'[^25] The physiognomist can thus suggest that these features are a
'*mediating middle*' between the individual's inner life (intentions) and their
externalities (actions). Harris directly identifies this thinking with Lavater,
and explains it in the following way:

> The individual's deeds are many and various, but all are mediated, all pass
> through hand or mouth, so hands and face and tone of voice (and the
> handwriting) are where the simple disposition will show. All that the agent
> has done, and all that she has suffered through circumstance and destiny, is
> recorded in these organs of the will.[^26]

A 'mediating' organ like the face is thus taken to be an outer sign of the
inner, but -- just as before -- this notion of *signifiying* leads to
significant problems. The face is 'indeed an expression', Hegel writes, 'but at
the same time it is so only in the sense of a *sign*, so that the makeup of that
through which it is expressed is completely indifferent to the content
expressed.'[^27] Hegel is here referring to what in linguistics is known as the
'arbitrariness' of a sign: something that Ferdinand de Saussure, who wrote a
century after Hegel, is often credited with. The arbitrariness of signs is not a
Saussurean concept, or even a particularly unintuitive concept: it is simply the
fact that a sign -- whether that is a word (for instance, 'squirrel') or a face
-- has no *inherent* relation to that which it signifies (for instance, an
actual squirrel, or an individual's inner state). The face renders visible the
invisible, Hegel concedes, 'but without [the invisible inner] itself being
intertwined with this appearance.'

The arbitrariness of a face's signification is the first blow to the
physiognomist's search for necessary law. The second is a repetition of a moment
that the psychologist already experienced: that is, the *freedom* of the
individual removes any necessary connection between their inner state and its
outer manifestation. In psychological observation, this meant that the
individual was free to choose how she was affected by her cultural environment.
In the case of physiognomy, it poses the following problem:

> In the way that in the previous relationships [e.g. that of psychology], in
> the circumstances lying before us [the cultural environment in the case of
> psychology, and the face and body in physiognomic context], there was an
> existent, and the individuality took for itself what *he* could and what *he*
> wanted from it, and he either submitted to this existent or he twisted it
> around, and for that reason the existent did not contain the necessity and
> essence of individuality. ... [Therefore,] to the individual, **the sign is as
> much its face as it is its mask**, which it can remove.[^28]

With this point, Hegel starts to move forward to the conclusion of his critique
of physiognomy. In doing so, he provides us with a helpful account of 'the
genuine thought that lies at the basis of ... the *science* of physiognomy'
(though he is reluctant to call it a 'science').[^29] This fundamental 'thought'
is that of a strict distinction between the 'theoretical' and the 'practical';
that is, between a non-essential outer which is some *manifestation* of an
essential inner. Of course, we have seen this mode of thinking occur time and
time again in the *Observing Reason* chapter. It is no surprise that Hegel
should now announce it as the archetypal feature of the observer's thinking. For
observational reason, 'inwardness' is 'supposed to be the true'. In this sense,
it is no surprise that *Kant*, a philosopher for whom reason is of utmost
importance, sees the ultimate reality of things as a kind of *inner* (the
in-itself) that lies beyond appearances and manifestations, and sees the true
moral worth of an act in its *inner* intention.[^30]

The problem with physiognomy's search for the 'true' inner is that it never
ventures beyond 'the unconscious judging' that most of us carry out in everyday
life. It's natural for us to make judgments about someone's character based on
their appearance -- whether these judgments are right or wrong. Physiognomy
simply has the confidence to suppose that these judgments can be governed by
some kind of law. Not only is there no necessity to be found for phsyiognomic
laws, as Hegel has shown in multiple ways, but the very subject matter of
physiognomy (i.e., bodily appearance) *cannot be rendered* into words or laws.
As Hegel puts it, the individual's expression (appearance) is 'infinitely
determinate': the physiognomist is stuck with the same kind of uncertainty that
sensuous certainty suffered from, because no quantity of words and concepts will
ever *exhaustively* describe all the determinatenesses of an individual,
especially when one is concerned with devising *law*, and not just a poetic or
literary portrait.[^31]

Physiognomy, in short, is incoherent. The everyday habits it emerges from might
remain worthwhile to a poet or an artist, but no *scientific* theory can emerge
in the practice of someone who *radically separates* individuals into an 'inner'
and 'outer', and then tries to repair this separation on the grounds of mere
assumption, inexpressible in language. In his last paragraph on physiognomy,
Hegel quotes Georg Christoph Lichtenberg's 1778 book *Über Physiognomik, wider
die Physiognomen*, which mocks Lavater's 'science' of physiognomy:

> If someone said, 'To be sure, you act like an honest man, but I can see from
> your face that you are forcing yourself to do so and are a knave at heart,'
> then any upright fellow, when addressed in that fashion, will, until the end
> of time, respond with a slap in the accuser's face.[^32]

Hegel sees more than just a joke in this remark. When the 'upright fellow'
retorts with a slap in the face, Hegel sees 'the refutation of the first
presupposition' of physiognomy: 'namely, that *the actuality* of a person is
supposed to be his face, etc.' The upright fellow is *performing* the
refutation, namely, the fact that *action* -- '*his deed*' -- is the real
actuality of an individual, not some ambiguous sign of a merely assumed inner.
The slap in Lichtenberg's remark is a wake-up call to the physiognomist, saying:
'my character is not in my face, not in my appearance, but in *what I do*!'
Thus, Hegel takes Lichtenberg's point -- which he endorses himself -- to be
this:

> The deed is something simply determinate [contrast with the 'infinite
> determinateness' of the face], universal, to be grasped in an abstraction; it
> is murder, theft, beneficence, a courageous act, and so on, and what it *is*
> can be *said* of it. The deed *is* this, and its being is not only a sign, it
> is the matter at issue itself.[^33]

This is an early sign of Hegel's insistence on individuals as primarily *doing*,
*acting* beings -- the insistence that will eventually drive us out of *Observing
Reason* entirely. For now, however, the stubborn observer makes one last attempt
at a science of observing the individual: namely, **phrenology**.
