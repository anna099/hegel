## Reason

### Observation of Self-Consciousness
#### (in its Purity and in its Relation to External Actuality:<br>Logical and Psychological Laws) {.subtitle}

It should be no surprise by now that this chapter, too, will end in failure.
Consciousness presses on throughout the *Phenomenology*, following Samuel
Beckett's words -- 'Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again.
Fail better.' -- until it reconciles itself with *that which makes it move* in
the first place.[^1] When consciousness takes on the role of *observing reason*,
it turns towards the world to try and proves its instinctive idea that the world
is rational; in other words, and as we have already seen many times, reason
wants to observe the world and find itself looking back. In its observation of
inorganic and organic nature, however, reason was only able to grasp its object
as static and dead, reduced to a kind of hollow mechanism. Rational
consciousness's subsequent turn to *itself*, which Hegel explores in this
section, is not just another analysis of the formation and transformation of
self-consciousness (as we had in the chapter *named* after self-consciousness);
rather, it is the moment where rational self-consciousness becomes an object for
itself, in just the same way that *nature* was previously.
