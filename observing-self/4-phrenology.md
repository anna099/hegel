Hegel recognises phrenology as the 'one relationship left over': the only way
that remains for the observer to understand the relationship between the
individual and spirit.[^34] Psychology considered the spirit of the individual
to be formed in relationship to their external surroundings; physiognomy located
spirit as something signified by the *outer* aspect of the individual, and was
therefore more 'zoomed-in' to the individual than psychology was. Phrenology
zooms in even closer, understanding spirit to *be* -- and not merely to be
*expressed by* -- the individual's 'immediate, fixed, purely existing
actuality': namely, the **skull**. As Slavoj Žižek writes,

> The final result of physiognomy is its utter *failure*: every signifying
> representation 'betrays' the subject; it perverts, deforms what it is supposed
> to reveal; there is no 'proper' signifier of the subject. And the passage from
> physiognomy to phrenology functions as the change of level from
> *representation* to *presence*: in opposition to gestures and grimaces, the
> skull is not a sign expressing an interior; it represents nothing; it is -- in
> its very inertia -- the immediate presence of the Spirit.[^35]

It is quite surprising that *Observing Reason*, a huge section of the
*Phenomenology* that deals with the development of natural sciences, should come
to its climax with a theory as pseudoscientific and utterly obsolete as
phrenology. It makes sense, however, when we consider that phrenology marks the
final *reductio ad absurdum* of reason that is content to merely *observe*: for
as long as we ignore that the real rationality of humanity is in our *social
activity*, in our *deeds* that realise us and leave a mark on the world after
our death, we will always end up with a picture of the human spirit as something
dead and abstract: '*spirit is a bone*', the phrenologist will (ridiculously)
come to conclude.[^36] Indeed, Hegel will actually briefly return to phrenology
in his final chapter (§790), reflecting on how it *proves* that, when taken as
devoid of activity, sociality, and culture, spirit is nothing at all.

Why is it the *skull* in particular that the observer chooses as the immediate
actuality of its focus? To start with, Hegel points out that the majority of bodily organs are, as the physiognomist recognised, 'mediating middles' between
the individual and the external world: the hands physically manipulate the
world, the sexual organs look to reproduce the individual, and so on. In this
sense, most organs are 'instruments'.[^37] In trying to find not a signifier of
spiritual individuality, but instead *individuality itself*, the observer must
find an organ wherein 'the individual is not turned outwards but is instead
reflected in his action' -- that is, an organ which is *for itself*. What about
the brain and the spinal cord? Taken together, this system 'may be considered as
the immediate presence of self-consciousness persisting within itself', Hegel
writes.[^38] Indeed, as soon as it becomes visible to an Other, 'it is a dead
being' that has lost its functionality. Is this not a sign of an organ that is
exclusively for-itself? However, the *activity* of the brain and spinal cord, no
matter how inwardly contained it might be, is active *for the sake of*
articulating the body in any particular way; as such, Hegel explains that

> the *being* reflected-into-itself of spirit in the brain itself is again only
> a mediating middle between its pure essence and its bodily articulation, a
> middle which must thus have the nature of both and also of the *existing*
> articulation in it.[^39]

The observer is thus forced to 'step back' further, and focus on the *skull* and
*spinal column*: the 'motionless fixed things' that indifferently encase the
brain and spinal cord. Now, as Hegel understands it, the phrenologist is focused
only on the skull (and not the spinal column) for two reasons: firstly, 'anyone
who thinks of the genuine location of spirit thinks not of the spine but only of
the head'; secondly, since 'knowing and acting' (or the instructions telling the
body and mind to act and to know) are driven 'through the spine', the spine
cannot be seen as a stable site of spirit.[^40] The phrenologist is thus left
with the skull, the *'caput mortuum'* (dead head), as their object of focus.

Having arrived at the skull as the supposed location of spirit, the first task
of the phrenologist is to understand the *causal relationship* between the
spirit, embodied in the skull, and the individual's body (specifically, the
brain, since this is the body part most directly related to the skull). This
might be a simple case of causation in one direction: perhaps the brain itself
is able to 'press the skull', 'widen it or flatten it', and so on;
alternatively, perhaps it is the skull that 'presses on the brain' and thus
determines the boundaries and capacities of the brain.[^41] Franz Joseph Gall,
the originator of phrenology, believed the former. It seems that a phrenologist
would be *unable* to believe the latter; since, if the skull influences the
brain, it therefore influences the individual's knowing and acting, too -- and
this externalisation of the skull's influence would deny its existence as purely
*for itself*. It seems that even *Darwin* (later than Gall *and* Hegel) also
adhered to the idea that the skull, being affected by the brain, was an
indication of mental capacity:

> The belief that there exists in man some close relation between the size of
> the brain and the development of the intellectual faculties is supported by
> the comparison of the skulls of savage and civilised races ...

> ... As [humans started to walk on two feet], the internal pressure of the
> brain, will, also, have influenced the form of the skull; for many facts shew
> how easily the skull is thus affected. ... [I]f the mental powers were to be
> much increased or diminished without any great change in the size of the body;
> the shape of the skull would almost certainly be altered.[^41.1]

Of course, the causal relation between skull and brain might not be simple and
one-way: there is also the possibility of a 'pre-established harmony'
determining the form of brain *and* skull at the same time. Now, while this
notion of pre-established harmony is found famously in *Leibniz's* work, Hegel
points out that this kind of skull-brain harmony wouldn't necessarily imply an
actual *correspondence* between skull and brain. They would have the same loose
relation as that of 'the form of the grape and the taste of wine'.[^42]
Consequently, even though this pre-established harmony between the skull and the
brain is the closest to the *actual truth* of the matter (as we know today), it
is rejected by the phrenologist.

For Gall, the brain must be an assortment of *multiple organs* to account for
the numerous psychological functions that were attributed to the brain in the
eighteenth- and early-nineteenth century.[^43] He thus divided the cerebral
cortex into around forty regions, assigned to functions as diverse as
comparison, destructiveness, hope, comprehension of size, and so on. The area of
skull that covers a particular brain region can be examined to reveal the
particular individual's capacity for whatever function is carried out in that
region. On this basis, the phrenologist's second task is: given a causal
relationship between the skull and the brain, what do the effects of this
relationship actually look like? Does a stronger capacity lead to a '*more
expanded* brain-organ', or a '*more contracted* brain organ'?[^44] Gall himself
believed that a protrusion on the skull (indicating a *larger* brain region)
indicated a stronger capacity for a particular function, but this was
essentially an assumption made on minimal grounds. The solution to this second
task, Hegel points out, remains 'undetermined'.

But as it turns out, this isn't necessarily a problem for the phrenologist, who
is able to make a distinction between the brain as an '*animal* part' and the
brain as 'the *being* of *self-conscious* individuality.'[^45] Observing
consciousness is only interested in the brain in the latter sense, the brain
that 'receives its value only through its indwelling meaning' -- that is,
through the *individual's spirit*. As Harris puts it, phrenology -- understood
properly as a form of observing reason -- is not interested in the 'skull/brain'
relation, but the 'skull/mind' relation. For this reason, the brain can be
understood as an organ that gains its 'value' or significance through an
individual's spirit, and the skull can be understood as the *actual existence*
of this spirit. Thus: 'The *actuality and existence of man is his
skull-bone.*'[^46]

This is the conclusive statement in Hegel's *reconstruction* of phrenology; we
are now prepared to see its *destruction* -- and thus the eclipse of reason's
purely theoretical, observing phase. The apparent absurdity of this conclusion
is worth paying attention to: we know -- both intuitively and from the adventure
in the *Self-Consciousness* chapter -- that individual spirit is formed through
social and ethical practices. That theoretical reason should conclude *instead*
that individual spirit is formed in only a few years of infancy, in the
ossification of the skull, is a significant embarrassment for reason. It is only
through a focus on *practice*, and not just theory, that reason can grasp the
subject (the individual spirit) in its rich, socially-formed existence. The
ridiculousness of phrenology *is* the ridiculousness of (purely) theoretical
reason. To fully realise this, however, we need to see exactly how phrenological
theory falls apart.

Hegel quickly gives multiple criticisms of the phrenologist. Firstly, the skull
has no movement, no activity, and *signifies* nothing. Looking at a skull on its
own, one could say nothing about the life of the individual who once possessed
it. Even when Hamlet speaks emotionally about Yorick, while examining his skull,
he is referring only to his memories of Yorick's life; the skull plays no part
in constructing these memories -- 'it is not a reminder of any conscious
animation', as Hegel says.[^47]

More criticisms arise when Hegel considers Gall's division of the skull into
multiple function-specific regions. How are we to determine which region
corresponds to a particular function? Perhaps, since our mental activity is
often associated with a physical feeling in our head, then '*stealing*,
*committing murder*, *writing poetry*, and so forth, might each by accompanied
by its own proper feeling, [with] its own particular location as well.'[^48] But
is *any* such feeling in the head determinate enough to give us its location? Of
course, Hegel had no knowledge of <span class="sc">MRI</span> scans, but a
contemporary quasi-phrenologist might want to suggest that a scan of the brain
can reveal which particular region is 'engaged' during a certain kind of
activity. But what if some strange individual was committing murder while also
writing poetry -- which of their 'engaged regions' in the scan (or which of
their 'feelings', for the traditional phrenologist) is to be associated with
each of their activities? As Hegel puts it, a murderer 'is neither only this
abstraction of a murderer, nor does he have only *one* protuberance and *one*
indentation.'[^49]

These criticisms lead Hegel to suppose that phrenological 'reasoning' is, in
fact, nothing but *imagination*. 'One *can imagine* the murderer with a high
bump here at this place on the skull and the thief with a bump over there', he
explains, but there is no real thinking that takes place beyond this
imagination.[^50] As Harris puts neatly, 'science is only possible where there
is a certain logical structure that makes this free imagining
illegitimate.'[^51] Phrenology has no such structure: like physiognomy, it is
simply a 'natural' practice of everyday life, tainted with unconscious biases --
and arguably *constituted* of nothing but these biases. It is perhaps no
surprise, then, that phrenology was famously used as a post-hoc legitimisation
of colonial views, a central part of the British and American racial
imagination. James Poskett recounts this story of George Combe, a Scottish
phrenologist and intellectual heir to Gall, whose book outsold Darwin's:

> Holding up a Native American skull, Combe pointed out that 'the Indian has
> more Destructiveness, less Cautiousness, less Benevolence.' This explained why
> Native Americans could not be enslaved. According to Combe, 'he has retained
> his freedom by being the proud, indomitable, and destructive Savage which such
> a combination indicates.' In contrast, the 'Negro' was 'gentler in nature' and
> so more easily subdued. Combe concluded by comparing the Native American and
> African skulls, suggesting that 'had the Negroes possessed a similar
> organization, to make useful slaves of them would have been impossible.'
> Phrenology, therefore, both explained and reinforced racial divisions.[^52]

Unfortunately, Hegel doesn't reflect much upon the relation of phrenology to
prejudice -- partly because the pseudoscience didn't truly grip the mainstream
until after his death. Nonetheless, he still mocks the phrenologists for having
no scientific basis whatsoever. If one is to explain an individual's behaviour
and character via bumps and dents on their head, he says, 'one may just as well
imagine the flying cow which was first caressed by the crab that rode on the
donkey'.[^53]

A phrenologist might try to accommodate for individual freedom and for the
socialisation of the individual by saying that the shape of the skull is
evidence only of an '*original disposition*', so that, if the phrenological
observation seems to be disproved, the phrenologist can respond by saying that
'this individual *really* is *supposed to be* what his skull proclaims him to be
according to the law, but he has an *original disposition* which has not been
cultivated and developed.'[^54] This is an important moment in the development
of phrenology, since it is the first time when the observer *consciously admits*
that their work is failing. By acknowledging that phrenological observation only
reveals *tendencies* -- and not *lawlike necessity* -- the observer is
acknowledging the superior importance of *freedom* in human character, and the
lack of scientific rigor in the theory of phrenology. 'In this way', Harris
remarks, 'Observing Reason finally sublates itself.'[^55] Hegel describes the
exact nature of this sublation in concise but revealing terms:

> We see the conjecturing **brought by the nature of the matter at issue** into
> saying, however *unthinkingly*, the *opposite* of what it affirms -- into
> saying that there is something indicated by this bone but *also* into saying
> with the same ease that the same thing is *not* indicated by this bone.[^56]

This is a crucial detail which is important for Hegel's whole thinking: the
contradiction that consciousness arrives at is not due to its limitations, but
due to 'the nature of the matter at issue' itself. That is, it is not through
careless mistakes but *careful attention* to the object of consideration that
consciousness arrives at contradictions. Consider how different this is to the
role of contradiction in *Kant*, for whom contradiction is an inevitable but
impassable phenomenon that occurs when reason poses itself questions that it
cannot answer. For Hegel, as we've seen in the whole of the *Phenomenology* so
far, and as is emphasised by this short quotation, contradiction is the
*positive sign of progress*. Contradiction is not a sign of consciousness's
misturning, but instead a sign of consciousness's *success* at interrogating its
object -- 'the nature of the matter at issue'.

How does this sublation play out for observing consciousness? In trying to
defend phrenology, by relegating it to the realm of *disposition* and
*tendency*, the observer unwittingly confesses that phrenology has no grasp of
scientific law -- that is, of necessity. This confession, fundamentally, is the
admission that spirit is determined by freedom and social activity that
*necessarily* cannot be rendered in the static rigidity of a skull: '*being* as
such' -- that is, any static determinateness like the skull -- 'is not the truth
of spirit at all'.[^57]

In the last paragraphs of *Observing Reason*, Hegel recapitulates the
development of observational thinking in order to demonstrate that phrenology
marks its ultimatum. He recalls how, in trying to grasp the dynamic, changing
objects of the world, reason wanted to find 'the concept ... present as a
thing'.[^58] When observing consciousness was forced to turn to *itself*, as the
only being that holds its movement and development within itself, it
consistently failed to find any lawlike necessity in the relation of some
'inner' to some 'outer'; at every stage (logic, psychology, physiognomy),
observation fails because the outer content 'is indifferent to the sign'.[^59]
In trying to overcome this 'indifference' -- that is, the gap between individual
spirit and that which is *observable* -- the observer moves its attention closer
and closer to the actual individual. For instance, the move from psychology to
physiognomy is a move from the 'outer' being the individual's *surrounding
environment*, to the 'outer' being the individual's outer (i.e. bodily)
*actuality*. Now, one sense in which phrenology is the pinnacle of observing
reason is that there is no static actuality closer to an individual than their
skull, a '*dead thing*' which is nonetheless central to the individual's life.
However, Hegel explains, this move to phrenology is particularly distinct; it is
not *just* a further step closer to the individual:

> What was sublated by the very first observation of inorganic nature, namely,
> that *the concept is supposed to present as a thing*, is established by this
> last mode of observation [i.e. phrenology] so as *to make the actuality of
> spirit itself into a thing*, or, to put it conversely, so as to give dead
> being the significance of spirit.[^60]

In other words, since the phrenologist takes the skull to be not a *sign* of
spirit but *spirit itself*, phrenology marks the development of observing reason
from (1) searching for spirit presented as a thing to (2) searching for a thing
present as spirit. The phrenologist isn't looking for a *representation* of
spirit, but is looking for spirit itself; in this sense, phrenology is markedly
different from psychology and physiognomy. And, as Harris remarks, 'Without this
violent break we could not close the circle of Observation as a whole', because
it is only when observing reason is led to the absurdity of phrenology -- the
absurdity of claiming that 'the *being of spirit is a bone*' -- that the
instinctive search for spirit in being as such is shown to be a dead end (as
explained above).[^61]

#### From Theory to Practice {#theory}

The meaning of an 'infinite judgment' is described by Kant in the *Critique of
Pure Reason* as follows:

> If I had said of the soul that it is not mortal, then ... nothing is said by
> my proposition but that the soul is one of the infinite multitude of things
> that remain if I take away everything that is mortal.[^62]

So, for Kant, infinite judgments are always negative in the sense that they only
state what the subject is *not*. At the end of *Observing Reason*, however,
Hegel identifies the conclusive statement of observing reason -- namely, 'that
the self is a thing' -- as an infinite judgment.[^63] Since it doesn't affirm a
negative, it doesn't fit Kant's criteria for infinit judgments; nonetheless, it
is still infinite for Hegel because, as Inwood's conveys it, 'the predicates
affirmed or denied lie beyond the (finite) range of predicates categorically
compatible with the subject.'[^64] The infinity of 'the self is a thing' (or,
'spirit is a bone') is in its *incorrectness*, and its absurdity. The judgment
is *false*, and yet we still take interest in it because it shows the dead-end
that lies at the end of the path of observational reason. It is 'a judgment
which sublates itself', Hegel writes, because it shows that all of the
observer's attempts at *mediation* have led to the equation of spirit with the
*immediacy* of pure being, and that consciousness can no longer even try to
'*find* itself *immediately*.'[^65] In this sense, the judgment is infinite in
that it is 'infinitely dissolving'.[^66]

The 'thing' that observing reason equated to selfhood and spirit is now
'determined as a negative object'; in other words, spirit is now to be found as
*not-being* -- that is, as an active *becoming*. Significantly, this is also the
long-awaited solution to the alienation of the unhappy consciousness. The climax
of unhappy consciousness saw self-consciousness become consciousness: in tragic
awareness of their dependence and contingency, the unhappy subject claimed that
*true* self-consciousness, *true* selfhood and agency, lay not within themselves
but within some external being (God, divinity, 'the beyond', etc.). Their
*unhappiness* was precisely their lack of a grasp on genuine self-consciousness,
and their dwelling among the other lowly *things* of the world. And this
association of the subject with thinghood is exactly what observing reason has
returned to, and exactly what is to be overcoming in the activity of
*self-actualisation*! Harris expresses this whole realisation quite clearly:

> Reason as Observation adopted the position of the Unchangeable Consciousness
> who 'owns all things.' How unsatisfactory that position is, we finally realize
> when it tries to own *itself* as a thing (the skull-record). The *immediacy*
> of the ownership relation must now be mediated. The self is to *be for
> itself*, by actualizing itself as its own end.[^67]

Hegel finishes the 206-paragraph-long examination of *Observing Reason* with a
joke. The phrenologist, he says, is wrapped up in irony insofar as they allow us
to make the profoundest step, wherein 'spirit pushes out from its inwardness' and
starts to actualise itself, in the most mundane, ignorant manner: equating
selfhood and spirit with a dead bone. This weird mix of profundity and
ignorance, he suggests, have

> the same kind of connection of higher and lower which, in the case of the
> living being, nature itself naively expresses in the combination of the organ
> of its highest fulfillment, the organ of reproduction, with the organ of
> urination.[^68]

We are now ready to see how spirit moves on towards its self-actualisation. The
stubborn phrenologist, meanwhile, is stuck in an ironic ignorance that conceals
a deep profundity; thus, an ignorance 'which remains within representational
thought conducts itself like urination.'
