#### Phrenology {#phreno}

Hegel recognises phrenology as the 'one relationship left over': the only way
that remains for the observer to understand the relationship between the
individual and spirit.[^34] Psychology considered the spirit of the individual
to be formed in relationship to their external surroundings; physiognomy located
spirit as something signified by the *outer* aspect of the individual, and was
therefore more 'zoomed-in' to the individual than psychology was. Phrenology
zooms in even closer, understanding spirit to *be* -- and not merely to be
*expressed by* -- the individual's 'immediate, fixed, purely existing
actuality': namely, the **skull**. As Slavoj Žižek writes,

> The final result of physiognomy is its utter *failure*: every signifying
> representation 'betrays' the subject; it perverts, deforms what it is supposed
> to reveal; there is no 'proper' signifier of the subject. And the passage from
> physiognomy to phrenology functions as the change of level from
> *representation* to *presence*: in opposition to gestures and grimaces, the
> skull is not a sign expressing an interior; it represents nothing; it is -- in
> its very inertia -- the immediate presence of the Spirit.[^35]

It is quite surprising that *Observing Reason*, a huge section of the
*Phenomenology* that deals with the development of natural sciences, should come
to its climax with a theory as pseudoscientific and utterly obsolete as
phrenology. It makes sense, however, when we consider that phrenology marks the
final *reductio ad absurdum* of reason that is content to merely *observe*: for
as long as we ignore that the real rationality of humanity is in our *social
activity*, in our *deeds* that realise us and leave a mark on the world after
our death, we will always end up with a picture of the human spirit as something
dead and abstract: '*spirit is a bone*', the phrenologist will (ridiculously)
come to conclude.[^36] Indeed, Hegel will actually briefly return to phrenology
in his final chapter (§790), reflecting on how it *proves* that, when taken as
devoid of activity, sociality, and culture, spirit is nothing at all.
