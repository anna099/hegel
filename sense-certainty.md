'Sensuous certainty' is the name for the intial kind of knowing an object;
specifically, the kind of knowing for which the object is *immediate*. Taking
any spatiotemporal thing as its object, sensuous-certainty has no limit as
regards its 'wealth', since it can take its object from anywhere in the infinite
boundaries of space and time, and can furthermore divide any such object into
more distinct objects. The object apprehended by sensuous-certainty is not only
immediate but *complete*, since nothing is taken away or added to it; instead,
it is laid before consciousness as *this* which *is*. In other words, it is
apprehended in its pure being. The apprehending consciousness, as well, is also
held in certainty, by itself, as another *this* which *is*; consequently, any
particular experience of sensuous-certainty takes the form: '*this* I, a
singular individual consciousness, knows *this* object, a singular individual
thing'. In the world of sensuous-certainty, there is no causality, no
unification, no essences or properties, no relations: there is merely the being
of manifold particulars. This is sensuous-certainty's claim to absolute
knowledge.

Clearly, then, while the strength of sensuous-certainty is in the *completeness*
of its object, its weakness is in the *abstractness* of its truth, since it
expresses nothing but the pure being of the object and of the consciousness
apprehending it. In fact, it is this abstractness and simplicity which reveals
to us the dialectic within sensuous-certainty. As a singular thing, the object
of sensuous-certainty is a *this* which is *here* and *now*. Each of these three
terms name the radical particularity of the thing. I have sensuous-certainty
*now* ... and yet, as soon as I have named this 'now', it is gone: the moment
has passed.  Likewise, if I face the thing, I can say that it is *here*, but if
I turn around, then while I can still refer to a 'here', it is no longer 'here'
that the thing in question is found. In both of these cases, the *Here* and
*Now* persevere, while the thing of which I had sensuous-certainty disappears.
That which we call 'now' is indifferent to whether it is 5:00 PM, 3:00 AM, or
any other time. Through every moment, the *Now* endures; it is *mediated*
through the moment. The moment is a particular expression of the *Now*, and the
location of sensuous-certainty is an expression of the *Here*. *Now* and *Here*
are thus *universals*. 'Now' means: *not* 5:00 PM, *not* 3:00 AM, *not* any
unique particular moment; as Hegel explains, 'As little as night and dary are
its being, it is just as much night and day. ... Such a simple is through
negation; it is neither this nor that, it is both a *not-this* and is just as
indifferent to being this or that, and such a simple is what we call a
*universal*.'[^1]

As such, the truth of sensuous-certainty is the opposite of its original truth.
At the start, its truth was in its consistent particularity; it is now in its
emergent universality. Sensuous-certainty has *refuted itself*, and language has
shown this: 'In language, we immediately refute what we *mean to say*, and since
the universal is the truth of sensuous-certainty, and language only expresses
this truth, it is, in that way, not possible at all that we could say what we
*mean* about sensuous being.'[^2] By this, Hegel shows that, just as language
necessarily deals only with universals (in 'this tree', both the word 'this' and
'tree' are mediated universals, as explained above), so too does
sensuous-certainty itself give rise to universals when it 'means' to refer only
to particulars. In the very moment, I might 'know what I mean' when I refer to
*this tree*; nonetheless, as soon as the words ('this tree') are *written down*,
my subjectivity is removed from them, and universality takes its place.
Consequently we find that what is persistent in sensuous-certainty's experience
of the *This* is not the *object*, but the subject *for whom the object is a
'This', here and now*. 'Now' is midnight, or noon, or whenever else, because *I*
name it so; 'now' is always *my* 'now'.

Who is this 'I'? As the subject that names an object to be a particular This, at
a particular *here and now*, it must too be a particular. There is an 'I' for
each moment; an 'I' for each This that is apprehended. However, this radical
particularity can only be realised by comparison - contradistinction - with
other radical particulars. From whose standpoint is this comparison carried out?
It is precisely through the *universal* 'I' that it is done. In all experience
of sensuous-certainty, 'what does not appears is *I as universal*, whose
[universal] seeing is neither a seeing of the tree nor of this house.' As such,
the truth of sensuous-certainty has shifted away from the object and on to the
subject.
