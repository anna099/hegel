#### Law-Giving Reason {#giving}

Now that the obsession with the crux of the matter has been inverted and fallen
into universal deception, and this deception has itself been inverted and moved
aside for the rise of spiritual essence, the scene is set for a new shape of
consciousness: that of 'law-giving reason'. When consciousness takes this shape,
it no longer takes its original determinate nature to be the primary, 'positive'
determination of its activity and purpose.[^50] Instead, consciousness starts to
grasp the 'spiritual essence' of society, and focuses on a new object whose
existence 'is the *actuality* and the doing of self-consciousness': no more
wasting time with intentions, aims, and reputations.[^51] This new object is
*ethical substance*, and it holds absolutely for our ethical consciousness: who
would want to transcend that which is substantiated by one's own activity (along
with the activity of everyone else), and from which actual laws can be derived,
so solidly that anyone with '*healthy reason*' immediately knows right from
wrong?[^52]

Though this might sound a little abstract so far, the following paragraphs
feature some of the most concrete argumentation to appear in the chapter on
*Individuality*. Hegel takes two reason-given laws -- laws that, to ethical
consciousness, might will be considered *laws of nature* -- and shows their
supposedly *immediate* value to amount, in truth, to very little.
