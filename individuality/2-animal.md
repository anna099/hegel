The individual now knows itself to be 'all reality', but *what is* this reality?
At first, it is not very much at all: the individual's sense of itself starts as
nothing but an '*abstract universal*', some *potential* cause or vocation.[^9]
Until a person acts upon the abstract idea of their vocation, it is really
nothing more than abstractness. As such, it is still crucial for us to focus on
the *activity* of the individual.

Individuality 'comes on the scene', Hegel writes, 'as an original determinate
nature.'[^10] A person is restricted -- their existence is in some part
determined -- by the kind of animal they are (an animal that cannot fly, that
cannot breathe underwater, etc.), and as such they are limited to a certain
range of activity. Within this range, however, '*the doing* of consciousness'
cannot be limited, and the individual is free. The 'original nature' of the
individual *is* the individual's potential, their *skill* -- whether that is the
skill of weaving, of painting, of cooking, or anything else. Indeed, Hegel
points out that the determinate nature of the individual is not regarded as 'a
restriction which it would want to transcend': unlike the unhappy consciousness,
who dreamt of overcoming its bodily existence (but also knew this dream to be
impossible), the real individual enjoys their limited capacities, because it is
*through* them -- when they are put into practice -- that the individual is
merged with reality.[^11]

The determinate nature of the individual determines how the individual
experiences their environment; in Kalkavage's words, the individual 'sees the
whole world through the specific coloration of his techno-medium and
originality.'[^12] Furthermore, the *actualisation* of the individual's talents
serves as a mediation between the individual's consciousness (their intentions,
the purpose of their activity, and so on) and the world itself. This is the
*rational* manifestation of the 'labor of the negative' that appeared in the
Preface and in the slave's liberation in *Self-Consciousness*: through the
individual's doing, they come to face 'the object as it has emerged from the
actor to be outside of him and to be *for him* as an *other*.'[^13] The
difference here is that, while the slave's work brought the slave to an
awareness of *themselves*, the real individual's work brings them to an
awareness not only of themselves but also of their unity with their environment,
of the 'permeation' of universality and individuality mentioned above.

As a real individual, my activity *negates* my original nature, since it
transforms it from an implicit *potentiality* into something actual and external
to me (in the environment objects and I work in and upon). Activity makes my
nature explicit and legible: 'doing is, in particular, the pure translation of
the form of the being not yet exhibited into the form of the being that is
exhibited.'[^14] Consequently, I cannot really know my own individuality until I
act upon it.

At this point, Hegel points out an apparent paradox involved in the individual's
activity. It seems that the individual 'is incapable of finding a beginning for
his actions': in order to act on one's individual nature, this nature must be
known; but it can only be known when it is made explicit in individual activity.
'The individual who sets himself to act therefore seems to be situated in a
*circle* in which every moment already presupposes the other.'[^15] Hegel
actually offers no clean logical solution to this paradox; rather, he claims
that the individual simply begins its activity *immediately*, without worrying
about '*beginnings*, *middles*, and *ends*', precisely because activity itself
*is* the beginning, middle, and *end* (in the sense of purpose) of itself. In
other words, we come to know the nature that inspires our activity because we
just 'get on with it', and our nature is revealed to us in the way we act.
Harris explains this point with a helpful anecdote:

> The little girl, of whom I once heard in a philosophy class, who asked "How
> can I know what I think, until I see what I say?" had her feet set firmly on
> the path towards a Real Individuality that will not deceive itself at least.
> But, of course, we could ask her how she knew what she was saying if she did
> not formulate it to herself before she said it.[^16]

At this point, we are ready to think about *other people* again. Importantly, it
is not only the individual who has determinate qualities. The object of their
work is determinate too, 'as an *existing actuality* freed from the doing'.[^17]
The individual looks upon their work, just as the slave of *Self-Consciousness*
did, and recognises it as an embodiment of negativity (since, for Hegel, all
determination is negation), produced by the negativity of the individual's
doing. The consequence of this is that individuals in the *Weltlauf* can compare
themselves to one another by assessing the objects of their neighbours' work.
Who has expressed their original nature most skillfully? Who has been limited by
their restricted skill? Hegel stresses that these comparisons are only
quantitative: there is no '*exaltation* nor *lamentation*', no assessments of
'good' or 'bad', but merely judgments regarding the 'translation' of the
individual's original nature from an abstract, *in-itself* potentiality to a
concrete, *actual* being.[^18]

It is when we enter the realm of others that dialectical tensions start to
emerge. Just as we saw with the law of the heart, the exposure of the individual
to the public forces the individual to face up to the *truth* of their
experience. 'In his work, [the individual] has placed himself outside of himself
and into the element of universality.'[^19] At this stage at least, the
individual can be understood as one of Leibniz's *monads*: simple and distinct
beings who move freely and act in order to express their essence.[^20] The
public's gaze upon the individual's work reminds us of Leibniz's remark about
monads:

> Monads just have no windows through which something can enter into or depart
> from them ... neither substance nor accident can enter a monad from
> without.[^21]

In the context of the individual, this means that the Other has no way of seeing
into the individual and their original nature; rather, they must make do with an
interpretation of the individual's *action*. (Here is another instance of
Hegel's proto-behaviourism, which we also saw in his chapter on physiognomy).
The public Other, as *interpreter*, thus has a comparable role to the *reader*
as depicted by Roland Barthes in his writing on 'the death of the author'. If we
imagine the individual and their action as a 'scriptor' and a 'text', what
Barthes suggests is in agreement with Hegel:

> The modern scriptor is born simultaneously with the text, is in no way
> equipped with a being preceding or exceeding the writing, is not the subject
> with the book as predicate; there is no other time than that of the
> enunciation and every text is eternally written *here and now*.[^22]

The final words of Barthes's remark -- 'every text is eternally written *here
and now*' -- is a clue towards Hegel's own thinking in this section. In
*Sensuous Certainty*, the concepts 'here and now' betrayed the immediate
particular and gave way to the universal that was the focus of *Perception*. The
'here and now' is not an immediate atom of space and time, but is universal --
or, in Barthes's words, 'eternal'. Here, in the 'spiritual animal kingdom', the
individual's action similarly betrays their (apparent) *private individuality*
and leads the individual into *universal consciousness* by -- as described above
-- forcing them to consider themselves as the embodiment of *negativity*, rather
than just a practitioner of particular *determinate* acts. 'The consciousness
which steps back from its work is in fact the universal consciousness,' Hegel
writes, 'because it becomes *absolute negativity*.'[^23]

The *Weltlauf* is thus a competition or a market in which individuals
universalise themselves through work, through the production of '*alien*
actuality', and in which they seek recognition for their alienated labour by the
judging eyes of the Other. The individual is still primary, but in the social
world, this primacy is only possible in the context of competition with others.
This constant competition for recognition (which we might as well call
'attention seeking') is what makes the *Weltlauf* an 'animal kingdom' -- or a
'zoo', as Robert Solomon more aptly renders it. An individual in the animal
kingdom can only fully exist when they are recognised, Solomon points out: 'not
in the crude mode of domination and submission, independence and dependence, as
in the "master-slave" parable, but by way of having a place in society, an
exalted place as a producer, a creator, an agent of self-expression.'[^24] The
chaos of the animal kingdom, the lunacy of the 'rat race', is all in pursuit of
this place.

When the individual was an individual*ist* -- in the case of the Faustian
pleasure-seeker, for instance -- they began by opposing activity (doing) to
actuality (being). The actuality of the world was in a dire state, in need of
overturning through the individualist's activity. For the individual of the
animal kingdom, however, the opposition of being and doing is the *result*.[^25]
Individual self-consciousness understands its 'original nature' to be its
*being*: the in-itself, the intention or original thought 'behind' their
activity. Their work, on the other hand, is the *doing*, which -- through its
release into the eyes of the public, and through the inevitable imperfections of
human labour -- never entirely matches up with the original being. Now, it is up
to the individual whether it is the original intention or the action itself that
is considered the *concept*, with the other regarded as the *reality* of this
concept; either way, the two remain mismatched, and it is *work itself* that
reveals this mismatch or contradiction:

> In its work, consciousness learns from its own experience about this
> *inadequation* of concept and reality that lies in the essence of
> consciousness. Therefore, it is in its work that, to itself, consciousness
> comes to be as it is in truth, and its empty concept of itself vanishes.[^26]

Contrary to Aquinas's definition of truth as an '*adequation* of thing and
intellect' [*adaequatio rei et intellectus*], Hegel finds the truth of the
individual to be an *inadequation*.[^27] And we are also far from the Cartesian
understanding, where pure thought takes us to a certainty of self-consciousness;
for the individual of the animal kingdom, truth is revealed through *action*,
and the truth turns out to be a matter of inevitable contradiction, rather than
stable certainty.
