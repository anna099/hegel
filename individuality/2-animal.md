The individual now knows itself to be 'all reality', but *what is* this reality?
At first, it is not very much at all: the individual's sense of itself starts as
nothing but an '*abstract universal*', some *potential* cause or vocation.[^9]
Until a person acts upon the abstract idea of their vocation, it is really
nothing more than abstractness. As such, it is still crucial for us to focus on
the *activity* of the individual.

Individuality 'comes on the scene', Hegel writes, 'as an original determinate
nature.'[^10] A person is restricted -- their existence is in some part
determined -- by the kind of animal they are (an animal that cannot fly, that
cannot breathe underwater, etc.), and as such they are limited to a certain
range of activity. Within this range, however, '*the doing* of consciousness'
cannot be limited, and the individual is free. The 'original nature' of the
individual *is* the individual's potential, their *skill* -- whether that is the
skill of weaving, of painting, of cooking, or anything else. Indeed, Hegel
points out that the determinate nature of the individual is not regarded as 'a
restriction which it would want to transcend': unlike the unhappy consciousness,
who dreamt of overcoming its bodily existence (but also knew this dream to be
impossible), the real individual enjoys their limited capacities, because it is
*through* them -- when they are put into practice -- that the individual is
merged with reality.[^11] This coexistence of restriction and freedom is a motif
that recurs throughout Hegel's work. Hegel repeatedly points out that *real*
freedom -- freedom that is practical and effective -- appears only in situations
wherein one is directed by certain norms or restrictions. As an example,
consider language: though someone (a Romantic, perhaps) might feel that the
rules of language are too narrow, preventing true human expression, what would a
language with no rules look like? It would presumably be indistinguishable from
a baby's babbling. It is *only because* of the restrictions of language that we
are able to say anything meaningful at all, because these restrictions introduce
a universal regulation to language that makes it communicable to others. On a
broader and more political scale, Slavoj Žižek uses the example of rules about
vaccinations:

> The freedom to choose being vaccinated or not is, of course, a formal kind of
> freedom; however, to reject vaccination effectively implies limiting my actual
> freedom as well as the freedom of others. ... My freedom is only actual as
> freedom within a certain social space regulated by rules and prohibitions. I
> can walk freely along a busy street because I can be reasonably sure that
> others on the street will behave in a civilized way towards me, will be
> punished if they attack me, if they insult me, etc. -- and it is exactly the
> same with vaccination.[^12]

In the present context, the restriction in question is the determinate nature of
the individual. This determinate nature determines how the individual
experiences their environment; in Kalkavage's words, the individual 'sees the
whole world through the specific coloration of his techno-medium and
originality.'[^13] Furthermore, the *actualisation* of the individual's talents
serves as a mediation between the individual's consciousness (their intentions,
the purpose of their activity, and so on) and the world itself. This is the
*rational* manifestation of the 'labor of the negative' that appeared in the
Preface and in the slave's liberation in *Self-Consciousness*: through the
individual's doing, they come to face 'the object as it has emerged from the
actor to be outside of him and to be *for him* as an *other*.'[^14] The
difference here is that, while the slave's work brought the slave to an
awareness of *themselves*, the real individual's work brings them to an
awareness not only of themselves but also of their unity with their environment,
of the 'permeation' of universality and individuality mentioned above.

As a real individual, my activity *negates* my original nature, since it
transforms it from an implicit *potentiality* into something actual and external
to me (in the environment objects and I work in and upon). Activity makes my
nature explicit and legible: 'doing is, in particular, the pure translation of
the form of the being not yet exhibited into the form of the being that is
exhibited.'[^15] Consequently, I cannot really know my own individuality until I
act upon it.

At this point, Hegel points out an apparent paradox involved in the individual's
activity. It seems that the individual 'is incapable of finding a beginning for
his actions': in order to act on one's individual nature, this nature must be
known; but it can only be known when it is made explicit in individual activity.
'The individual who sets himself to act therefore seems to be situated in a
*circle* in which every moment already presupposes the other.'[^16] Hegel
actually offers no clean logical solution to this paradox; rather, he claims
that the individual simply begins its activity *immediately*, without worrying
about '*beginnings*, *middles*, and *ends*', precisely because activity itself
*is* the beginning, middle, and *end* (in the sense of purpose) of itself. In
other words, we come to know the nature that inspires our activity because we
just 'get on with it', and our nature is revealed to us in the way we act.
Harris explains this point with a helpful anecdote:

> The little girl, of whom I once heard in a philosophy class, who asked "How
> can I know what I think, until I see what I say?" had her feet set firmly on
> the path towards a Real Individuality that will not deceive itself at least.
> But, of course, we could ask her how she knew what she was saying if she did
> not formulate it to herself before she said it.[^17]

At this point, we are ready to think about *other people* again. Importantly, it
is not only the individual who has determinate qualities. The object of their
work is determinate too, 'as an *existing actuality* freed from the doing'.[^18]
The individual looks upon their work, just as the slave of *Self-Consciousness*
did, and recognises it as an embodiment of negativity (since, for Hegel, all
determination is negation), produced by the negativity of the individual's
doing. The consequence of this is that individuals in the *Weltlauf* can compare
themselves to one another by assessing the objects of their neighbours' work.
Who has expressed their original nature most skillfully? Who has been limited by
their restricted skill? Hegel stresses that these comparisons are only
quantitative: there is no '*exaltation* nor *lamentation*', no assessments of
'good' or 'bad', but merely judgments regarding the 'translation' of the
individual's original nature from an abstract, *in-itself* potentiality to a
concrete, *actual* being.[^19]

It is when we enter the realm of others that dialectical tensions start to
emerge. Just as we saw with the law of the heart, the exposure of the individual
to the public forces the individual to face up to the *truth* of their
experience. 'In his work, [the individual] has placed himself outside of himself
and into the element of universality.'[^20] At this stage at least, the
individual can be understood as one of Leibniz's *monads*: simple and distinct
beings who move freely and act in order to express their essence.[^21] The
public's gaze upon the individual's work reminds us of one specific remark about
monads:

> Monads just have no windows through which something can enter into or depart
> from them ... neither substance nor accident can enter a monad from
> without.[^22]

In the context of the individual, this means that the Other has no way of seeing
into the individual and their original nature; rather, they must make do with an
interpretation of the individual's *action*. (Here is another instance of
Hegel's proto-behaviourism, which we also saw in his chapter on physiognomy).
The public Other, as *interpreter*, thus has a comparable role to the *reader*
as depicted by Roland Barthes in his writing on 'the death of the author'. If we
imagine the individual and their action as a 'scriptor' and a 'text', what
Barthes suggests is in agreement with Hegel:

> The modern scriptor is born simultaneously with the text, is in no way
> equipped with a being preceding or exceeding the writing, is not the subject
> with the book as predicate; there is no other time than that of the
> enunciation and every text is eternally written *here and now*.[^23]

The final words of Barthes's remark -- 'every text is eternally written *here
and now*' -- is a clue towards Hegel's own thinking in this section. In
*Sensuous Certainty*, the concepts 'here and now' betrayed the immediate
particular and gave way to the universal that was the focus of *Perception*. The
'here and now' is not an immediate atom of space and time, but is universal --
or, in Barthes's words, 'eternal'. Here, in the 'spiritual animal kingdom', the
individual's action similarly betrays their (apparent) *private individuality*
and leads the individual into *universal consciousness* by -- as described above
-- forcing them to consider themselves as the embodiment of *negativity*, rather
than just a practitioner of particular *determinate* acts. 'The consciousness
which steps back from its work is in fact the universal consciousness,' Hegel
writes, 'because it becomes *absolute negativity*.'[^24]

The *Weltlauf* is thus a competition or a market in which individuals
universalise themselves through work, through the production of '*alien*
actuality', and in which they seek recognition for their alienated labour by the
judging eyes of the Other. The individual is still primary, but in the social
world, this primacy is only possible in the context of competition with others.
This constant competition for recognition (which we might as well call
'attention seeking') is what makes the *Weltlauf* an 'animal kingdom' -- or a
'zoo', as Robert Solomon more aptly renders it. An individual in the animal
kingdom can only fully exist when they are recognised, Solomon points out: 'not
in the crude mode of domination and submission, independence and dependence, as
in the "master-slave" parable, but by way of having a place in society, an
exalted place as a producer, a creator, an agent of self-expression.'[^25] The
chaos of the animal kingdom, the lunacy of the 'rat race', is all in pursuit of
this place.

When the individual was an individual*ist* -- in the case of the Faustian
pleasure-seeker, for instance -- they began by opposing activity (doing) to
actuality (being). The actuality of the world was in a dire state, in need of
overturning through the individualist's activity. For the individual of the
animal kingdom, however, the opposition of being and doing is the *result*.[^26]
Individual self-consciousness understands its 'original nature' to be its
*being*: the in-itself, the intention or original thought 'behind' their
activity. Their work, on the other hand, is the *doing*, which -- through its
release into the eyes of the public, and through the inevitable imperfections of
human labour -- never entirely matches up with the original being. Now, it is up
to the individual whether it is the original intention or the action itself that
is considered the *concept*, with the other regarded as the *reality* of this
concept; either way, the two remain mismatched, and it is *work itself* that
reveals this mismatch or contradiction:

> In its work, consciousness learns from its own experience about this
> *inadequation* of concept and reality that lies in the essence of
> consciousness. Therefore, it is in its work that, to itself, consciousness
> comes to be as it is in truth, and its empty concept of itself vanishes.[^27]

Here is the real problem with this mismatch: while I change, my works are still
out there, unchanging. And they are subjected to the interpretation of a public
that, for all intents and purposes, does not know me. So how can I be sure that
*I myself* will be well thought of by others? It seems that me and my work
completely fall apart; a 'vanishing' [*Verschwindens*] takes place wherein I
lose my authority on the work.[^28]

But -- for someone whose primary goal is to express themselves, *to act* -- is
this vanishing such a problem? As Inwood writes, the individual 'did at least
perform an action, expressing its purpose in actuality and, from its own point
of view, its performance was coherently unified. What does it matter if its work
vanishes in the public sphere?'[^29] To be sure, there is always a chance that
my works and actions might unfortunately be misunderstood, but that's *all* that
there is: a *chance*. It is 'fortune' that decides how a public work is
interpreted.[^30] Thus, the contingent element of my activity is itself
contingent. An individual is free to simply keep acting, and to *reassert* their
original intentions in spite of the public's misinterpretations. Moreover, this
second assertion of the intention is more than a simple repetition: it is an
instance of Hegelian 'determinate negation' -- the 'vanishing of the vanishing'
[*Verschwinden des Verschwindens*] wherein the public's negation of the work is
itself negated, and the individual moves from mere *expression* towards an
assertion of *truth*.[^31]

Looked at in this way, the scrutiny of the public is only 'a vanishing moment',
as is the work itself. Indeed, even the original intention, the *idea* behind
the work, is not what truly matters. The crux of the matter, the 'thing itself'
[*die Sache selbst*] is the 'unity' of the whole process: the whole course of
action wherein the individual 'unreservedly affirms itself and is experienced as
what endures, independently of the *contingency* of [their] doing and the
contingency of the circumstances, means, and actuality.'[^32] Recall Hegel's
comment right at the start of the *Phenomenology*: 'the whole is the result
together with the way the result comes to be ... the unadorned result is just
the corpse that has left the tendency behind.'[^33] What we are seeing now is
the practical individual coming to the realisation of this fact. In
understanding the whole *process* of work to be the crux of the matter, the
individual recognises the *category* in its Hegelian sense: the unity of thought
and being ('the permeation of individuality and objectivity', as Hegel puts it
in this passage) that is brought about as something processual and
developmental.[^34] As Hyppolite puts it, 'The "thing itself" is actual reality
envisaged as the work of self-consciousness, the real at the level of creating
consciousness.'[^35]

The thing itself expresses 'the spiritual essentiality' of the individual's
activity, without being equal to any isolated moment of this activity. In this
way, it is a new sort of object, 'born out of self-consciousness as its *own*
object, without thereby ceasing to be a free-standing, genuine object.'[^36]
This object, Hegel tells us, will go through stages of development that parallel
those of sensuous certainty and perception. (A major difference here is that,
while those early chapters were concerned with 'regular' consciousness, we are
now concerned with consciousness of the *self*.)

At the start of this development, one is conscious of the thing itself only
*immediately*, apprehending it as a 'simple essence'. In this sense, the thing
itself is an abstract predicate that applies equally to all of its moments but
does not truly *unify* them. 'It is the *genus* which is to be found in all
these moments as its *species* and which is likewise free-standing from all of
them.'[^37] Equipped with this sense of the thing itself, the individual
embodies what Hegel calls 'honest consciousness'. This individual is *honest*
because they regard all of their activities -- and all moments of their
activities -- to be honourable. At every step of their journey, the honest
individual considers themselves to be engaged with the thing itself, the crux of
the matter. Just as naïve sensuous certainty failed to recognise the
universality involved in the observation that every moment is always 'here' and
'now', the honest individual 'always gains satisfaction' in the belief that
their every move is the crux of the matter, the real heart of their
activity.[^38] This attitude goes so far as to apply even to activities carried
out by other people:

> If finally something of interest to [the honest individual] has come to be
> without his own involvement in it, then to himself it is this *actuality*
> itself which is the crux of the matter just because of the interest that he
> himself finds in it, which is quite independent of whether or not he brought
> about that actuality.[^39]

The honest individual 'makes one meaning after another into [the thing itself],
and then it forgets one after the other.'[^40] Indeed, the only thing that
unifies these multiple instances of the thing itself is the individual
themselves: 'they are so plainly related to each other' insofar as 'The *pure*
doing is essentially *this* individual's doing.'[^41] In this sense, the
'honest' individual is, in truth, concerned above all with themselves, with
their own ego. Accordingly, we can see the honest consciousness as a parody of
Fichte's idealism -- at least in the form that Hegel understood it. For Hegel,
the foundation of Fichtean idealism is the ego's 'pure thinking of itself, pure
selfconsciousness.'[^42] Similarly, the honest individual is self-congratulatory
about its activity, concerning any action to be the crux of the matter simply
because they deem it to be so. As Judith Shklar writes,

> It is really because it is his 'own' cause that the 'honest' participant cares
> about it and imputes values to it. His activity is only a reflection of his
> self-absorption. ... He is like the spectator who uses art to display his good
> taste. Causes [i.e. cruxes of the matter] are a foil to demonstrate his
> 'honesty'. It remains a matter of the self playing with itself.[^43]

The honest individual is **deceiving** themselves: having no grasp on how their
activity's *subjective* side (i.e., their investment in it) relates to its
*objective* side (i.e., its supposed status as the crux of the matter), they
'run from the truth' by constantly changing their mind about their focus and
values.[^44] Through this deception, however, they also end up deceiving others:
when an individual declares a certain cause or vocation to be the crux of the
matter, they declare it to be of *universal* interest: the activity 'is exposed
by consciousness to the light of day and is represented as being *for
others*.'[^45] Accordingly, other people start adopting and appropriating the
activity, and making it their own. But as soon as this happens, the individual
has lost what really made the activity worthwhile to them: namely, that it was
*them* doing it themselves. Furthermore, the other people who adopted the
activity, having been given no *objective* reasons to find the activity truly
worthwhile, are *also* carrying it out in a merely self-congratulatory manner.
For the first individual, 'what interests him about the [supposed] crux of the
matter is what it has to do with *his own* goings-on'; likewise, the 'haste' of
the others to 'offer their assistance' amounts to nothing more 'but their own
desire to see and to show off not the *crux of the matter* but only *their own*
activities'.[^46] Deception and 'hoodwinking' spreads throughout the community.

If this seems too abstract, consider a contemporary example: the 'hipster'. At
least according to the stereotype, a hipster will fanatically praise something
(perhaps a filmmaker, a style of music, or a way of dressing), declaring it to
be the current Big Thing -- the *thing itself*. However, if other people were to
start adopting this Big Thing for themselves (going to see the filmmaker's
films, or listening to that particular style of music, etc.), the hipster would
quickly denounce the thing, and perhaps claim that it has been misunderstood by
the public: 'they didn't get it!'. It is quickly revealed that the hipster's
'interest' in the thing was nothing but self-interest in disguise: it only
earned its status as the thing itself insofar as the hipster could claim it as
their *own*.

People will only tolerate such deception for so long. When an individual loses
the trust of their community -- and, moreover, continues to deceive *themselves*
-- they eventually come to the realisation that their conception of their
activity is deeply flawed. No matter how much these 'animal' individuals compete
with each other, 'still they all mutually learn from experience that *everyone*
is on the move and considers himself invited' and that, when an overly
individualistic notion of the crux of the matter is abandoned, something else is
'brought into the open.'[^47] Through experience, each member of the 'animal
kingdom' comes to learn that the *real* crux of the matter is not an exclusively
individual thing, but a social thing: it 'is only a fact insofar as it is the
*doing* of *each* and *all*'. This kind of fact, in Hegelian language, is called
'*spiritual essence*'.[^48]

As Robert Pippin has suggested, Hegel's conclusion of this chapter is that a
conception of practical reason wherein my activity 'is rational for me simply if
it fits and helps realize my overall life plan and interests' is, ultimately,
*not* reason in any meaningful sense. Put otherwise, activity can be rational
'only if tied to the development or realization of a supra-individual subject,
*Geist*.'[^49]
