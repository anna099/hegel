#### The Spiritual Animal Kingdom and Deception {#animal}

The individual now knows itself to be 'all reality', but *what is* this reality?
At first, it is not very much at all: the individual's sense of itself starts as
nothing but an '*abstract universal*', some *potential* cause or vocation.[^9]
Until a person acts upon the abstract idea of their vocation, it is really
nothing more than abstractness. As such, it is still crucial for us to focus on
the *activity* of the individual.

Individuality 'comes on the scene', Hegel writes, 'as an original determinate
nature.'[^10] A person is restricted -- their existence is in some part
determined -- by the kind of animal they are (an animal that cannot fly, that
cannot breathe underwater, etc.), and as such they are limited to a certain
range of activity. Within this range, however, '*the doing* of consciousness'
cannot be limited, and the individual is free. The 'original nature' of the
individual *is* the individual's potential. Indeed, Hegel points out that the
determinate nature of the individual is not regarded as 'a restriction which it
would want to transcend': unlike the unhappy consciousness, who dreamt of
overcoming its bodily existence (but also knew this dream to be impossible), the
real individual enjoys their limited capacities, because it is *through* them --
when they are put into practice -- that the individual is merged with
reality.[^11]

The determinate nature of the individual determines how the individual
experiences their environment; in Kalkavage's words, the individual 'sees the
whole world through the specific coloration of his techno-medium and
originality.'[^12] Furthermore, the *actualisation* of the individual's talents
serves as a mediation between the individual's consciousness (their intentions,
the purpose of their activity, and so on) and the world itself. This is the
*rational* manifestation of the 'labor of the negative' that appeared in the
Preface and in the slave's liberation in *Self-Consciousness*: through the
individual's doing, they come to face 'the object as it has emerged from the
actor to be outside of him and to be *for him* as an *other*.'[^13] The
difference here is that, while the slave's work brought the slave to an
awareness of *themselves*, the real individual's work brings them to an
awareness not only of themselves but also of their unity with their environment,
of the 'permeation' of universality and individuality mentioned above.

As a real individual, my activity *negates* my original nature, since it
transforms it from an implicit *potentiality* into something actual and external
to me (in the environment objects and I work in and upon). Activity makes my
nature explicit and legible: 'doing is, in particular, the pure translation of
the form of the being not yet exhibited into the form of the being that is
exhibited.'[^14] Consequently, I cannot really know my own individuality until I
act upon it.

At this point, Hegel points out an apparent paradox involved in the individual's
activity. It seems that the individual 'is incapable of finding a beginning for
his actions': in order to act on one's individual nature, this nature must be
known; but it can only be known when it is made explicit in individual activity.
'The individual who sets himself to act therefore seems to be situated in a
*circle* in which every moment already presupposes the other.'[^15] Hegel
actually offers no clean logical solution to this paradox; rather, he claims
that the individual simply begins its activity *immediately*, without worrying
about '*beginnings*, *middles*, and *ends*', precisely because activity itself
*is* the beginning, middle, and *end* (in the sense of purpose) of itself. In
other words, we come to know the nature that inspires our activity because we
just 'get on with it', and our nature is revealed to us in the way we act.
Harris explains this point with a helpful anecdote:

> The little girl, of whom I once heard in a philosophy class, who asked "How
> can I know what I think, until I see what I say?" had her feet set firmly on
> the path towards a Real Individuality that will not deceive itself at least.
> But, of course, we could ask her how she knew what she was saying if she did
> not formulate it to herself before she said it.[^16]
