<!-- Introduction -->
[^1]: §394.
[^2]: See §231-3.
[^3]: §395. See §235 for Hegel's definition of *the category*: 'the *simple* unity of self-consciousness and being.'
[^4]: §394, §396.
[^5]: Kojève, *Introduction à la lecture de Hegel* (Éditions Gallimard, 1947), p. 90 (my translation).
[^6]: §396.
[^7]: §394, §396.
[^8]: Pinkard, *The Sociality of Reason*, p. 115. Rousseau was not necessarily the first to write of his life outside of a strictly religious narrative; Ẓahīr-ud-Dīn Muhammad Bābur's *Bāburnāma* (1530) is an even earlier example of such writing outside of Europe.

[^9]: §397.
[^10]: §398.
[^11]: §399.
[^12]: Slavoj Žižek, ‘Les Non-Dupes Errent’, The Philosophical Salon, September 2021, <https://thephilosophicalsalon.com/les-non-dupes-errent/>.

[^14]: §400. For the 'labor of the negative' and the slave's labour, see §19 and §195.

[^16]: Ibid. Emphasis added.
[^17]: Harris, *Hegel's Ladder*, II, p. 88.
[^18]: §402.
[^19]: §403. In most English translations of the *Phenomenology*, §402 is erroneously split into two paragraphs. Pinkard's translation, which I am quoting from, fixes this error; as such, if you are reading any other translation, my paragraph citations from §403 on will be smaller by 1.
[^20]: §404.
[^21]: Hyppolite makes this comparison in *Genesis and Structure*, p. 304; Harris makes it in *Hegel's Ladder*, II, pp. 81 ff.

[^30]: §406.
[^31]: §408. Cf. Harris, *Hegel's Ladder*, II, p. 97.
[^32]: §408. Do not confuse this 'thing itself' with the Kantian 'thing in-itself' [*Ding an sich*], which is a less practical and more epistemological concept.
[^33]: §3.
