[^1]: §394.
[^2]: See §231-3.
[^3]: §395. See §235 for Hegel's definition of *the category*: 'the *simple* unity of self-consciousness and being.'
[^4]: §394, §396.
[^5]: Kojève, *Introduction à la lecture de Hegel* (Éditions Gallimard, 1947), p. 90 (my translation).
[^6]: §396.
[^7]: §394, §396.
[^8]: Pinkard, *The Sociality of Reason*, p. 115. Rousseau was not necessarily the first to write of his life outside of a strictly religious narrative; Ẓahīr-ud-Dīn Muhammad Bābur's *Bāburnāma* (1530) is an even earlier example of such writing outside of Europe.
[^9]: §397.
[^10]: §398.
[^11]: §399.
[^12]: Kalkavage, *The Logic of Desire*, p. 211.
[^13]: §400. For the 'labor of the negative' and the slave's labour, see §19 and §195.
[^14]: §401.
[^15]: Ibid. Emphasis added.
[^16]: Harris, *Hegel's Ladder*, II, p. 88.
[^17]: §402.
[^18]: §403. In most English translations of the *Phenomenology*, §402 is erroneously split into two paragraphs. Pinkard's translation, which I am quoting from, fixes this error; as such, if you are reading any other translation, my paragraph citations from §403 on will be smaller by 1.
[^19]: §404.
[^20]: Hyppolite makes this comparison in *Genesis and Structure*, p. 304; Harris makes it in *Hegel's Ladder*, II, pp. 81 ff.
