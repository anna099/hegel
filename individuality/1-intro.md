### Individuality Which, to Itself,<br>is Real in and for Itself

With the fall of virtue, the lone individual has reached its apex, and can no
longer pretend that wisdom and happiness can be found when one lives outside of
society and the way of the world. Self-consciousness has been brought to the
realisation that individual action, regardless of its intentions, is part of a
social whole greater than any one person. What this means, Hegel explains, is
that 'Self-consciousness has now grasped the concept of itself, which was
initially only our concept of it.'[^1] Hegel is referring here to the *idealist*
concept of self-consciousness, which served as the starting point of the whole
*Reason* chapter, namely: self-consciousness is that which knows itself to be
'all reality'.[^2]

Now that the individual no longer acts 'in *opposition* to immediately existent
actuality [i.e. society]', and instead recognises itself as *part* of that
actuality, it has *reconciled* self-consciousness and being. In other words, now
that it has truly grasped the concept of what it really is, self-conscousness
'is the category which has become consciousness of itself.'[^3]
