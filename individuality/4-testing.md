#### Law-Testing Reason {#testing}

At this point, consciousness takes the formal universality that emerged from
law-giving reason's *failure* and assigns a *positive* role to it: formal
universality -- that is, 'pure reason' -- is now used to *test* laws that are
already contingently, externally given.[^62] It no longer has the role of *giving*
laws -- seemingly out of thin air -- as law-giving reason did. The test of
formal university is simple. Given some maxim, it asks: is this maxim
*self-contradictory* or not? The principle of non-contradiction thus becomes the
ultimate barometer of morality. As such, we have arrived at a simplified form of
Kant's moral philosophy as it was outlined in his *Groundwork*. For Kant, a
maxim can count as a moral law only if you can act on it while also acting as if
'the maxim of your action were to become by your will a universal laws of
nature' without any contradiction arising.[^63] It is precisely this idea that
is examined in *Law-Testing Reason*.

Hegel takes as an example the maxim that *there ought to be property*. In a
quasi-Kantian manner, let's examine this maxim *in and for itself* -- without
any reference to its utility, potential consequences, intentions, or any other
extraneous factor.
