#### Law-Testing Reason {#testing}

At this point, consciousness takes the formal universality that emerged from
law-giving reason's *failure* and assigns a *positive* role to it: formal
universality -- that is, *reason* and the principle of non-contradiction -- is
now used to *test* laws that are already contingently, externally given.[^62] It
no longer has the role of *giving* laws -- seemingly out of thin air -- as
law-giving reason did. The test of formal university is simple. Given some
maxim, it asks: is this maxim *self-contradictory* or not? The principle of
non-contradiction thus becomes the ultimate barometer of morality. As such, we
have arrived at a simplified form of Kant's moral philosophy as it was outlined
in his *Groundwork*. For Kant, a maxim can count as a moral law only if you can
act on it while also acting as if 'the maxim of your action were to become by
your will a universal laws of nature' without any contradiction arising.[^63] It
is precisely this idea that is examined in *Law-Testing Reason*.

Hegel takes as an example the maxim that *there ought to be property*. In a
quasi-Kantian manner, let's examine this maxim *in and for itself* -- without
any reference to its utility, potential consequences, intentions, or any other
extraneous factor. To have property means that every individual is *entitled* to
what they own. There is nothing self-contradictory about this. However, there is
also no self-contradiction in the *absence* of property, which would amount to
every individual's *lack* of entitlement to anything. Property and no-property
contradict *one another*, but on their own they are each completely stable. As
such, the Kantian test has told us nothing: it justifies *anything* that is
formulated as an abstract rule but loses its discriminatory power when competing
abstract rules are placed alongside one another. 'Just because the criterion is
a tautology and is indifferent with regard to the content, it incorporates one
content into itself with the same ease that it does its opposite.'[^64] Hegel's
main point here is that reason, especially in such a formalist manifestation as
the principle of non-contradiction, is totally inadequate in evaluating maxims
that are given in a contingent, socially constituted community. Indeed, this
approach to moral evaluation is not only philosophically deficient, but is also
the sign of an alienation from ethical life; as Judith Shklar argues,
law-testing reason 'is merely a symptom of a disintegrated society':

> For an Antigone or any completely socialized citizen the very idea that laws

> intelligence. That was so because men have only particular and specific
> obligations and these cannot be universalized into general, timeless and
> unconditional duties.[^65]

Later, in his *Encyclopaedia*, Hegel repeats his criticism when he remarks that
when practical thinking takes only the '*abstract identity* of the
understanding' as its determining factor, it 'does not get beyond the formalism
that was supposed to be the last word of *theoretical* reason.'[^66] In a way,
and insofar as *Law-Testing Reason* can be taken as truly aiming at Kant, Hegel
takes the Kantian criticism of pre-critical Enlightenment and repeats it on Kant
himself. Kant famously critiqued the Enlightenment's insistence on the purity of
reason (or observation, in the case of empiricism) on the grounds of its
internal contradictions discovered by philosophers like Hume and Rousseau.
However, in his own insistence on a transcendental separation of 'reason' from
'nature' (and, indeed, from *spirit*), Kant restricted himself to a 'formalism'
that is unable to present or authorise anything substantive. 'Without any appeal
to what *has become* authoritative for a specific community, nor to what in that
community's accounts of why what it has taken as authoritative really is
*genuinely* authoritative, no determinate set of moral principles can be
generated.'[^67]

As such, the law-giving and law-testing manifestations of reason not only fail
to prop up ethical life, but in fact demonstrate a profound alienation from
ethical life. Law-giving reason is 'the tyrannical outrage that makes
*arbitrariness* into law', and law-testing reason amounts to 'a freedom from
absolute laws [which] takes absolute laws to be an issuance of an *alien
arbitrary* will.'[^68] In both cases, consciousness mistakes its own reason and
willing for actual ethical substance, which still remains only in the background
(most prominently as the 'alien will' which 'gives' reason laws to be tested).
