<h4 id="in-its-purity-and-in-its-relation-to-external-actuality-logical-and-psychological-laws" class="subtitle">(in its Purity and in its Relation to External Actuality:<br>Logical and Psychological Laws)</h4>
<p>It should be no surprise by now that this chapter, too, will end in failure. Consciousness presses on throughout the <em>Phenomenology</em>, following Samuel Beckett’s words – ‘Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.’ – until it reconciles itself with <em>that which makes it move</em> in the first place.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> When consciousness takes on the role of <em>observing reason</em>, it turns towards the world to try and proves its instinctive idea that the world is rational; in other words, and as we have already seen many times, reason wants to observe the world and find itself looking back. In its observation of inorganic and organic nature, however, reason was only able to grasp its object as static and dead, reduced to a kind of hollow mechanism.</p>
<p>Rational consciousness’s subsequent turn to <em>itself</em>, which Hegel explores in this section, is not just another analysis of the formation and transformation of self-consciousness (as we had in the chapter <em>named</em> after self-consciousness); rather, it is the moment where rational self-consciousness becomes an object for itself, in just the same way that <em>nature</em> was previously. As Harris has suggested, the observer of self-consciousness is best described as a <em>biographer</em>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> To start with, the observer is going to try and find ‘logical and psychological laws’ that govern conscious thought. Consciousness <em>observes</em> its own thought, and then asks: by what standards or rules is this thinking carried out? Consequently, this part of the Reason chapter is Hegel’s analysis of <strong>logic</strong>; and, interestingly, it is only a few pages long.</p>
<p>In the search for logical and psychological laws, the observer first finds within herself ‘the <em>laws of thought</em>’ – what we might identify as the law of non-contradiction, the law of identity, and so on.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Now, since pure thinking <em>as such</em> is an ‘abstract movement’, concerned with universal ideas rather than particular objects, these laws of thought are ‘supposed’ by the observer ‘not to be the <em>entire</em> truth but nonetheless to be <em>formally</em> true.’<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> For instance, the law of identity on its own (<em>x = x</em>) expresses only the abstract form of an arbitrary possible object, rather than an object present in reality. This is a common critical idea regarding logic: it is too formal, too abstract, to tell us anything about the world. However, Hegel’s critique is that the <em>opposite</em> is true. The observer is mistaken; logic is not devoid of <em>content</em>, but in fact devoid of <em>form</em>. Insofar as the logical ‘laws of thought’ are derived from mere observation of a particular creature (that is, the observer themselves), they take the form of ‘a <em>found</em> content’, or ‘a given’.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The observer has mistaken the same mistake that was made in the observation of nature: the very act of observation, and the attempt to find <em>law</em>, has taken the inherent dynamism and movement out of the world, rendering it as something wholly static. As Hegel writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the course of being studied, [the ‘laws of thought’] are torn away from the context of movement and are arranged as singulars … these determinatenesses are not lacking in content since they in fact have a determinate content. What they lack is form, which is their essence.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it stands, the laws of thought aren’t actually ‘universal’ rules of the forms of thinking (and of thinkable things); in fact, they are mere contingent observations of ‘the content of thought’. Thus, ‘observation is not knowing itself’, and it ‘inverts its nature into the shape of <em>being</em>, i.e., it grasps its negativity’ – that is, its <em>movement</em> – ‘only as <em>laws</em> of being.’ Yet again, the shortcoming of observing reason is that it finds <em>doing</em> in the world, and falsely renders it as static <em>being</em>.</p>
<h4 id="psych">Psychology</h4>
<p>Consequently, the observer must observe self-consciousness as an <em>active</em> process, if it is to find the laws that govern it. Hegel actually suggests that, in taking this step forward (i.e. towards the acknowledgment of self-consciousness as <em>active</em>), the observer is ‘guided by the very nature of the matter which is at issue’, though she does not yet comprehend ‘the way this all hangs together.’<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Though it’s not entirely clear, this might be a hint that the observer is getting closer to realising <em>its own role</em> in that which it is observing. Either way, the observation of self-consciousness as <em>active</em> marks a decisive move away from <em>logic</em> and towards <strong>psychology</strong>, which Hegel defines as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psychology contains the class of laws according to which spirit conducts itself in various ways towards the various modes of its actuality as an <em>only found otherness</em>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few interesting things to note in this single sentence. First of all, this definition makes reference not to self-consciousness but to <em>spirit</em>, both as an active force ‘conducting itself’, and as something with ‘various modes of actuality’. In this context, we should therefore understand ‘spirit’ in two different senses: first, it is the set of ‘habits, mores, and ways of thinking’ in which we found ourselves as self-consciousness: this is spirit in the sense of ‘actuality’. Secondly, spirit is that which is <em>manifest as self-consciousness</em>; in other words, spirit is the mental, social, and historical context which is manifested in every individual self-consciousness. As such, the ‘class of laws’ contained in psychology concern the way that <em>acting</em> self-consciousness ‘conducts itself’ in the context of its contemporary habits, mores, and so on.</p>
<p>The observer (who, for now, we can call ‘the psychologist’) finds that self-consciousness conducts itself in two ways towards the actualities of spirit. Firstly, it <em>conforms</em> by ‘receiving into itself’ the norms and mores of its culture, allowing itself to be the <em>form</em> to social <em>content</em>. In this regard, self-consciousness ‘<em>comes to be according to</em> these’ cultural phenomena. Secondly, however, the self has the option to <em>rebel</em>. Like the slave from the self-consciousness chapter, the activity of the rebellious self-consciousness takes the form of <em>transformative work</em>; self-consciousness <em>makes what is objective come to be adequate to itself</em>,’ Hegel explains.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This second, rebellious tendency of self-consciousness itself has two varieties: on the one hand, if ‘the individual sublates that universal actuality [culture and the actualities of spirit, etc.] in an only singular manner’, they count as a <em>criminal</em>. On the other hand, if the self’s rebellion is ‘in a universal manner which thereby acts for all,’ its activity ‘brings about another world’ with a transformed spirit, and thus the self is a <em>revolutionary</em>. (Incidentally, it is interesting that, apart from a metaphorical usage in <em>Force and the Understanding</em>, the notion of criminality has its first appearance in the <em>Phenomenology</em> in the examination of psychology. This might lend itself to a comparison with Foucault’s historical work, 150 years after Hegel, which examines the ‘Great Confinement’ of the modern age, wherein psychological classification became part of a legal punitive process.)<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, these tendencies of self-consciousness’s psychological activity are only two among many others. As a whole, Hegel calls them ‘<em>universal modes</em>’, and he is aware that the psychologist cannot help but be ‘astonished’ that so many different ‘faculties, inclinations, and passions’ can reside in <em>one</em> mind, ‘restless movements’ that somehow sit next to one another.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This point resonates even more today, after Freud’s discovery of the multiple antithetical drives that exist within the human psyche. In all their variety, how are these universal modes (or ‘faculties’) to be observed in their manifestations in individual people? As Hegel points out, it is possible for the psychologist to simply enumerate the varying ‘inclinations’ in different people, or their differing intellectual strengths, and so on, like an IQ test does. But in practice, this strategy is of little more use than ‘enumerating the species of insects, mosses, and so on,’ he writes, because it takes each individual as a ‘contingent separation’, entirely divorced from the social and cultural influence on their minds.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> If the psychologist wants to find reason in the individual’s psyche, they must acknowledge that ‘the essence of individuality is the universal of spirit.’ In other words, the individual’s cultural environment, with all of the actualities of spirit, must inform the psychologist’s observation.</p>
<p>How can the relation between an individual and their ‘circumstances, situations, habits, mores, religion’ be understood as <em>law</em>?<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> A psychologist might want to claim that an individuality’s personhood is nothing but a reflection of their environment; a historian of so-called ‘Great Men’ might want to claim the reverse, that a particular era’s culture and environment was nothing but the reflection of the will of a few strong individuals. For Hegel, any such law – which cleanly places ‘the individual’ on one side and ‘society’ (and culture, religion, etc.) on the other – is mistaken. This is for the simple reason that no individual is born entirely separate from their environment. To suggest so would presumably be a contradiction of the very meaning of ‘environment’! Rather, Hegel points out, individuality ‘comes to be in accordance with [the norms of its environment] <em>as</em> conducting itself in opposition to them.’<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In other words, an individual and their environment – that is, the environment around them <em>as they experience and understand it</em> – are so irretrievably interrelated that one cannot be comprehended without reference to another. As Hyppolite puts it clearly,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world that acts on us is already “our world”; we see it through ourselves. And we can come to know an individual’s world only if we begin with that individual. We can specify an influence only if we know the person who undergoes it, and thereby determines it.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This realisation has a fatal consequence for the psychologist: if the particular relation between an individual and their world is determined <em>by the individual</em> – that is, on account of individual <em>freedom</em> – how can the necessity of a <em>law</em> enter the picture? Hegel thus concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The individual either lets the stream of actuality with its flowing influence <em>have its way</em> in him, or he breaks it off and turns that stream of influence on its head [i.e., negates it]. <em>Psychological necessity</em> thereby becomes such an empty phrase that it includes the absolute possibility that what is supposed to have had this influence could very well also not have had any influence whatsoever.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="phren">Physiognomy and Phrenology</h4>
<p>Having found no place for law in the individual’s free mind, our observer gives up her short-lived career in psychology and turns to the more visible aspect of human existence: the ‘distinctive determinateness’ of individuality, the ‘rigidly fixed being’ of an individual’s actuality: that is, the <strong>body</strong>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> This move seems plausible: it seems intuitive that the body is an actuality closer to an individual’s ‘inner life’ than the actualities of spirit explored above. In ancient times, Plato had supposed that the human body was designed by the gods to house the soul, and that every basic function of the body could be traced back to this purpose.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In Hegel’s own era, scientists like Johann Kaspar Lavater revived the discipline of ‘physiognomy’, claiming that one could discern somebody’s character and personality based on an observation of their physical appearance (especially, in the case of Lavater, of the face). In this final part of <em>Observing Reason</em>, Hegel will criticise physiognomy and phrenology as forms of pseudoscience; their shortcomings, we will see, are somewhat similar to those of psychology.</p>
<p>For the physiognomist, Hegel says, the body is an outer <strong>sign</strong> of an individual’s inner life. Indeed, since we cannot literally peer inside the mind of a person, we rely on the body and its activity (facial expressions, speech, and so no) as it ‘makes known what he [the person] <em>is</em>, in the sense of putting his original nature into practice.’ With this idea, we arrive at another formulation of the ‘outer-expressing-inner’ motif that appears so often in the <em>Phenomenology</em>. The body is understood as a kind of ‘record’, signifying what the individual <em>has done</em>: it is the congealed history of an individual’s activity.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> According to some, this idea is a classic element of Enlightenment thinking; as Adorno and Horkheimer wrote, ‘animism spiritualized the object, whereas industrialism [of the modern, ’enlightened’ era] objectifies the spirits of men.’<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Quite quickly, however, Hegel takes apart this ambitious idea that the appearance of our bodies is a tell-tale sign of what lies within us. First of all, he points out that the process of human <em>acting</em> isn’t rightly understood as something ‘inner’ eventually manifesting as something ‘outer’; rather, ‘the inner … is the <em>activity</em> itself.’<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> An individual’s activity is nothing at all until it is acted out, so we have no basis for supposing some prior, ‘inner’ cause of the activity. Alasdair MacIntyre puts this criticism in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we see someone with a sad expression on his face, we do not infer to an inner sadness he feels on the basis of an observed correlation between such a physical arrangement of the facial features and inner states of sadness. We read or interpret the expression as one of sadness in the light of the conventions in our culture for interpreting facial expressions.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>MacIntyre’s reference to our <em>interpretation</em> (‘in light of conventions’) of bodily expression leads to Hegel’s second point; namely, that when our activity becomes visible to others through our facial expression, body language, and so on, it becomes ‘an actuality cut off from the individual.’<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> When individual activity is ‘publicly’ manifested, the actor has no authority on what this activity ‘means’, signifies, and so on. In Hegel’s words, ‘language and labor’ – that is, all the visible activities of an individual – ‘are expressions in which the individual on his own no longer retains and possesses himself; rather, he lets the inner move wholly outside of him and he thus <em>abandons it to the other</em>.’<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>These first two points lead to a third: as Hegel puts rather opaquely, ‘we can just as well say that these expressions express the inner too much as we can say that they express it too little.’ Imagine that I mean to act in a certain way, and that my activity doesn’t deceive me: my ‘meaning’ is interpreted by an Other accurately. Now, as previously stated, there is really no difference between my ‘meaning’ and the activity itself; consequently, ‘no opposition remains between [the activity] and the inner’, and there is thus no ‘relation’ within which the observer can find a law.</p>
<p>Finding no stable law within the <em>activity</em> of a body, the physiognomist can still turn to the <em>features</em> of a body to try an access an individual’s inner life. Rather than the words that someone’s voice speaks, or the gestures that their hands perform, the physiognomist can instead look to the ‘<em>tone</em> and <em>range</em> of the voice’, and ‘the <em>simple lines of the hand</em>’, taking these features to be signs of something inner.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> There are two advantages to this strategy: first of all, like the signs (that is, ‘signifiers’) in language, these features are stable and consistent, especially when compared to the fluidity of body language and vocal expression. Secondly, in Hegel’s words, ‘the <em>organ</em> of activity is just as <em>much</em> a <em>being</em> as it is a doing’: that is to say, body parts like the mouth and hand are so central and essential to an individual’s activity that, in a sense, what they <em>are</em> is simply what the individual <em>does</em>. It is ‘the hand by which a person brings himself to appearance and actualizes himself’, Hegel writes: ‘It is the ensouled artisan of his fortune.’<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
