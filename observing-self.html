<p>It should be no surprise by now that this chapter, too, will end in failure. Consciousness presses on throughout the <em>Phenomenology</em>, following Samuel Beckett’s words – ‘Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.’ – until it reconciles itself with <em>that which makes it move</em> in the first place.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> When consciousness takes on the role of <em>observing reason</em>, it turns towards the world to try and proves its instinctive idea that the world is rational; in other words, and as we have already seen many times, reason wants to observe the world and find itself looking back. In its observation of inorganic and organic nature, however, reason was only able to grasp its object as static and dead, reduced to a kind of hollow mechanism.</p>
<p>Rational consciousness’s subsequent turn to <em>itself</em>, which Hegel explores in this section, is not just another analysis of the formation and transformation of self-consciousness (as we had in the chapter <em>named</em> after self-consciousness); rather, it is the moment where rational self-consciousness becomes an object for itself, in just the same way that <em>nature</em> was previously. The observer is going to try and find ‘logical and psychological laws’ that govern conscious thought. Consciousness <em>observes</em> its own thought, and then asks: by what standards or rules is this thinking carried out? Consequently, this part of the Reason chapter is Hegel’s analysis of <strong>logic</strong>; and, interestingly, it is only a few pages long.</p>
<p>In the search for logical and psychological laws, the observer first finds within herself ‘the <em>laws of thought</em>’ – what we might identify as the law of non-contradiction, the law of identity, and so on.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Now, since pure thinking <em>as such</em> is an ‘abstract movement’, concerned with universal ideas rather than particular objects, these laws of thought are ‘supposed’ by the observer ‘not to be the <em>entire</em> truth but nonetheless to be <em>formally</em> true.’<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> For instance, the law of identity on its own (<em>x = x</em>) expresses only the abstract form of an arbitrary possible object, rather than an object present in reality. This is a common critical idea regarding logic: it is too formal, too abstract, to tell us anything about the world. However, Hegel’s critique is that the <em>opposite</em> is true. The observer is mistaken; logic is not devoid of <em>content</em>, but in fact devoid of <em>form</em>. Insofar as the logical ‘laws of thought’ are derived from mere observation of a particular creature (that is, the observer themselves), they take the form of ‘a <em>found</em> content’, or ‘a given’.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The observer has mistaken the same mistake that was made in the observation of nature: the very act of observation, and the attempt to find <em>law</em>, has taken the inherent dynamism and movement out of the world, rendering it as something wholly static. As Hegel writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the course of being studied, [the ‘laws of thought’] are torn away from the context of movement and are arranged as singulars … these determinatenesses are not lacking in content since they in fact have a determinate content. What they lack is form, which is their essence.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it stands, the laws of thought aren’t actually ‘universal’ rules of the forms of thinking (and of thinkable things); in fact, they are mere contingent observations of ‘the content of thought’. Thus, ‘observation is not knowing itself’, and it ‘inverts its nature into the shape of <em>being</em>, i.e., it grasps its negativity’ – that is, its <em>movement</em> – ‘only as <em>laws</em> of being.’ Yet again, the shortcoming of observing reason is that it finds <em>doing</em> in the world, and falsely renders it as static <em>being</em>.</p>
<p>Consequently, the observer must observe self-consciousness as an <em>active</em> process, if it is to find the laws that govern it. Hegel actually suggests that, in taking this step forward (i.e. towards the acknowledgment of self-consciousness as <em>active</em>), the observer is ‘guided by the very nature of the matter which is at issue’, though she does not yet comprehend ‘the way this all hangs together.’<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Though it’s not entirely clear, this might be a hint that the observer is getting closer to realising <em>its own role</em> in that which it is observing. Either way, the observation of self-consciousness as <em>active</em> marks a decisive move away from <em>logic</em> and towards <strong>psychology</strong>, which Hegel defines as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psychology contains the class of laws according to which spirit conducts itself in various ways towards the various modes of its actuality as an <em>only found otherness</em>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
