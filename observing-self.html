<p>It should be no surprise by now that this chapter, too, will end in failure. Consciousness presses on throughout the <em>Phenomenology</em>, following Samuel Beckett’s words – ‘Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.’ – until it reconciles itself with <em>that which makes it move</em> in the first place.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> When consciousness takes on the role of <em>observing reason</em>, it turns towards the world to try and proves its instinctive idea that the world is rational; in other words, and as we have already seen many times, reason wants to observe the world and find itself looking back. In its observation of inorganic and organic nature, however, reason was only able to grasp its object as static and dead, reduced to a kind of hollow mechanism. Rational consciousness’s subsequent turn to <em>itself</em>, which Hegel explores in this section, is not just another analysis of the formation and transformation of self-consciousness (as we had in the chapter <em>named</em> after self-consciousness); rather, it is the moment where rational self-consciousness becomes an object for itself, in just the same way that <em>nature</em> was previously.</p>
