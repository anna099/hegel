<p>It should be no surprise by now that this chapter, too, will end in failure. Consciousness presses on throughout the <em>Phenomenology</em>, following Samuel Beckett’s words – ‘Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.’ – until it reconciles itself with <em>that which makes it move</em> in the first place.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> When consciousness takes on the role of <em>observing reason</em>, it turns towards the world to try and proves its instinctive idea that the world is rational; in other words, and as we have already seen many times, reason wants to observe the world and find itself looking back. In its observation of inorganic and organic nature, however, reason was only able to grasp its object as static and dead, reduced to a kind of hollow mechanism.</p>
<p>Rational consciousness’s subsequent turn to <em>itself</em>, which Hegel explores in this section, is not just another analysis of the formation and transformation of self-consciousness (as we had in the chapter <em>named</em> after self-consciousness); rather, it is the moment where rational self-consciousness becomes an object for itself, in just the same way that <em>nature</em> was previously. The observer is going to try and find ‘logical and psychological laws’ that govern conscious thought. Consciousness <em>observes</em> its own thought, and then asks: by what standards or rules is this thinking carried out? Consequently, this part of the Reason chapter is Hegel’s analysis of <strong>logic</strong>; and, interestingly, it is only a few pages long.</p>
<p>In the search for logical and psychological laws, the observer first finds within herself ‘the <em>laws of thought</em>’ – what we might identify as the law of non-contradiction, the law of identity, and so on.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Now, since pure thinking <em>as such</em> is an ‘abstract movement’, concerned with universal ideas rather than particular objects, these laws of thought are ‘supposed’ by the observer ‘not to be the <em>entire</em> truth but nonetheless to be <em>formally</em> true.’<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> For instance, the law of identity on its own (<em>x = x</em>) expresses only the abstract form of an arbitrary possible object, rather than an object present in reality. This is a common critical idea regarding logic: it is too formal, too abstract, to tell us anything about the world. However, Hegel’s critique is that the <em>opposite</em> is true. The observer is mistaken; logic is not devoid of <em>content</em>, but in fact devoid of <em>form</em>. Insofar as the logical ‘laws of thought’ are derived from mere observation of a particular creature (that is, the observer themselves), they take the form of ‘a <em>found</em> content’, or ‘a given’.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The observer has mistaken the same mistake that was made in the observation of nature: the very act of observation, and the attempt to find <em>law</em>, has taken the inherent dynamism and movement out of the world, rendering it as something wholly static. As Hegel writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the course of being studied, [the ‘laws of thought’] are torn away from the context of movement and are arranged as singulars … these determinatenesses are not lacking in content since they in fact have a determinate content. What they lack is form, which is their essence.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it stands, the laws of thought aren’t actually ‘universal’ rules of the forms of thinking (and of thinkable things); in fact, they are mere contingent observations of ‘the content of thought’. Thus, ‘observation is not knowing itself’, and it ‘inverts its nature into the shape of <em>being</em>, i.e., it grasps its negativity’ – that is, its <em>movement</em> – ‘only as <em>laws</em> of being.’ Yet again, the shortcoming of observing reason is that it finds <em>doing</em> in the world, and falsely renders it as static <em>being</em>.</p>
<p>Consequently, the observer must observe self-consciousness as an <em>active</em> process, if it is to find the laws that govern it. Hegel actually suggests that, in taking this step forward (i.e. towards the acknowledgment of self-consciousness as <em>active</em>), the observer is ‘guided by the very nature of the matter which is at issue’, though she does not yet comprehend ‘the way this all hangs together.’<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Though it’s not entirely clear, this might be a hint that the observer is getting closer to realising <em>its own role</em> in that which it is observing. Either way, the observation of self-consciousness as <em>active</em> marks a decisive move away from <em>logic</em> and towards <strong>psychology</strong>, which Hegel defines as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psychology contains the class of laws according to which spirit conducts itself in various ways towards the various modes of its actuality as an <em>only found otherness</em>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few interesting things to note in this single sentence. First of all, this definition makes reference not to self-consciousness but to <em>spirit</em>, both as an active force ‘conducting itself’, and as something with ‘various modes of actuality’. In this context, we should therefore understand ‘spirit’ in two different senses: first, it is the set of ‘habits, mores, and ways of thinking’ in which we found ourselves as self-consciousness: this is spirit in the sense of ‘actuality’. Secondly, spirit is that which is <em>manifest as self-consciousness</em>; in other words, spirit is the mental, social, and historical context which is manifested in every individual self-consciousness. As such, the ‘class of laws’ contained in psychology concern the way that <em>acting</em> self-consciousness ‘conducts itself’ in the context of its contemporary habits, mores, and so on.</p>
<p>The observer (who, for now, we can call ‘the psychologist’) finds that self-consciousness conducts itself in two ways towards the actualities of spirit. Firstly, it <em>conforms</em> by ‘receiving into itself’ the norms and mores of its culture, allowing itself to be the <em>form</em> to social <em>content</em>. In this regard, self-consciousness ‘<em>comes to be according to</em> these’ cultural phenomena. Secondly, however, the self has the option to <em>rebel</em>. Like the slave from the self-consciousness chapter, the activity of the rebellious self-consciousness takes the form of <em>transformative work</em>; self-consciousness <em>makes what is objective come to be adequate to itself</em>,’ Hegel explains.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This second, rebellious tendency of self-consciousness itself has two varieties: on the one hand, if ‘the individual sublates that universal actuality [culture and the actualities of spirit, etc.] in an only singular manner’, they count as a <em>criminal</em>. On the other hand, if the self’s rebellion is ‘in a universal manner which thereby acts for all,’ its activity ‘brings about another world’ with a transformed spirit, and thus the self is a <em>revolutionary</em>. (Incidentally, it is interesting that, apart from a metaphorical usage in <em>Force and the Understanding</em>, the notion of criminality has its first appearance in the <em>Phenomenology</em> in the examination of psychology. This might lend itself to a comparison with Foucault’s historical work, 150 years after Hegel, which examines the ‘Great Confinement’ of the modern age, wherein psychological classification became part of a legal punitive process.)<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, these tendencies of self-consciousness’s psychological activity are only two among many others. As a whole, Hegel calls them ‘<em>universal modes</em>’, and he is aware that the psychologist cannot help but be ‘astonished’ that so many different ‘faculties, inclinations, and passions’ can reside in <em>one</em> mind, ‘restless movements’ that somehow sit next to one another.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> This point resonates even more today, after Freud’s discovery of the multiple antithetical drives that exist within the human psyche. In all their variety, how are these universal modes (or ‘faculties’) to be observed in their manifestations in individual people? As Hegel points out, it is possible for the psychologist to simply enumerate the varying ‘inclinations’ in different people, or their differing intellectual strengths, and so on, like an IQ test does. But in practice, this strategy is of little more use than ‘enumerating the species of insects, mosses, and so on,’ he writes, because it takes each individual as a ‘contingent separation’, entirely divorced from the social and cultural influence on their minds.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> If the psychologist wants to find reason in the individual’s psyche, they must acknowledge that ‘the essence of individuality is the universal of spirit.’ In other words, the individual’s cultural environment, with all of the actualities of spirit, must inform the psychologist’s observation.</p>
