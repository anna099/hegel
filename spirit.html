<h4 id="history-in-the-phenomenology">History in the <em>Phenomenology</em></h4>
<p>According to György Lukács, in the <em>Phenomenology</em> the entirety of human history (up to 1807, at least) is ‘traversed <em>three times</em>’.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Using the terms that Hegel adopts later in the <em>Encyclopaedia</em>, Lukács considers these three repetitions to be concerned with <em>subjective spirit</em>, <em>objective spirit</em>, and finally <em>absolute spirit</em>. The first part covers the development of <em>thought</em> throughout history, from sensuous certainty to law-testing reason. The second part, which consists only of the chapter on <em>Spirit</em>, repeats this historical account from the perspective of the objective – social – context in which thought takes place. Finally, in the chapters on <em>Religion</em> and <em>Absolute Knowing</em>, we arrive at an absolute standpoint where the whole of history can be surveyed at once and the ‘laws <em>governing the movement</em> of history’ or ‘the dialectics of reality’ can be comprehended.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In this interpretation, the <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> is literally a history book; sensuous certainty is understood to be chronologically prior to perception, phrenology is understood as a successor (at least indirectly) to Baconian science, and so on.</p>
<p>This view of Hegel’s book is not very popular anymore. For a start, if Hegel were really trying to write a history, he would have made some significant errors: for example, the unhappy consciousness he describes quite early in the book exhibits a religious alienation (separation from God) that has manifested <em>throughout</em> history, in some cases after Hegel’s death (for example, in Kierkegaard). And although there are some coincidental accuracies in the ordering of positions (Augustine, for example, was a skeptic before he was an unhappy Christian, just like the <em>Phenomenology</em>’s protagonist), they are outnumbered by the <em>in</em>accuracies (in Hegel’s narrative, stoicism precedes skepticism; in Greece, Pyrrho preceded Zeno). However, these points could be interpreted as signs that Hegel merely wrote a <em>bad</em> history – not that he didn’t intend to write a history at all. Michael N. Forster defends Lukács’s reading on the basis of certain remarks that Hegel himself makes:<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The series of the figurations of consciousness which consciousness traverses on this path is the <strong>full history</strong> of the <em>cultivation</em> of consciousness into science.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Only the whole spirit is in time, and the shapes, which are shapes of the whole <em>spirit</em> as such, exhibit themselves <strong>in a sequence</strong> [<em>Aufeinanderfolger</em>], one after the other.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it really the case, however, that ‘history’ or ‘sequence’ in this sense necessarily refers to the <em>actual</em> history of humanity, in the precise order that it took place? It is more accurate to think of the <em>Phenomenology</em> as a narrative of the development of thought (and subjectivity, society, and so on) that <em>takes the shape of a history</em> but is not itself directly correspondent with ‘real’ history. In what we have read so far, the concrete historical phenomena named by Hegel have only been <em>examples of manifestations</em> of particular shapes of consciousness, and this is wholly distinct from them <em>being</em> these shapes exactly. Hegel acknowledges this explicitly when he writes in the <em>Self-Consciousness</em> chapter: ‘As it has consciously appeared in the history of spirit, this freedom of self-consciousness has, as is well known, been called <em>stoicism</em>.’<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The ‘real’ stoicism – that is, the movement elaborated by Zeno, Seneca, and so on – is simply one ‘conscious appearance’ in history of what Hegel is talking about (albeit a particularly prominent appearance). The narrative depicted in the <em>Phenomenology</em> is thus a possible manifestation of the development of consciousness – a development whose stages manifest in contingent ways but is nonetheless governed by the necessity of logic.</p>
<p>With that being said, it is nonetheless the case that the chapters on <em>Spirit</em> and <em>Religion</em> are more consciously informed by ‘real’ history. We will see in <em>Spirit</em>, for example, that the Enlightenment reaches its truth in a revolution which eventually culminates in ‘terror’ – and this, of course, is precisely what happened in Europe at the turn of the nineteenth century. This relates to what Lukács got <em>right</em> about the structure of the <em>Phenomenology</em>: namely, that it is in the <em>Spirit</em> chapter that the history of society is foregrounded, no longer a ‘shadowy, enigmatic backcloth’ for the development of <em>individual</em> consciousness, but rather ‘a coherent rational order’ that allows us to comprehend ‘the rise of modern civil society’ (which, according to Lukács, is Hegel’s central preoccupation).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="what-is-spirit">What is Spirit?</h4>
<p>As such, we are now at the moment where spirit comes to the foreground of the book’s focus. Given the title of the book – the <em>Phenomenology of</em> <strong><em>Spirit</em></strong> – we can be forgiven for being surprised that it has taken so long for this to happen. We might be especially surprised, given that the concept of ‘spirit’, thought it has been used quite a few times, is still without a concrete definition. Nonetheless, we can find some clarifications by looking back to the preface. In §25, Hegel makes two important remarks: firstly, ‘That the true is only actual as a system, or, that substance is essentially subject, is expressed in the representation that expresses the absolute as <em>spirit</em>.’ Secondly, ‘Spirit knowing itself as spirit is <em>science</em>. Science is its actuality.’ What are we to make of this? For a start, Hegel seems to suggest that in order for us to achieve philosophy’s goal of conceiving the true (or the absolute) not just as substance but also as subject, we must express the absolute ‘as <em>spirit</em>.’<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Secondly, spirit <em>is</em> – it achieves its actuality – through knowing itself, and this self-knowledge is what Hegel calls ‘science’, or systematic philosophy. Consequently, we can take from these remarks that, for philosophy to rise from ‘the love of knowing’ to ‘actual knowing’ (§5), we must conceive of the absolute as something that comes to understand itself and that, through this process of self-interpretation, also becomes more actualised.</p>
<p>This seems far too abstract, however, and it leaves us with a rather general and unhelpful definition of ‘spirit’ (as ‘that which is actualised through its self-interpretation’). Things become clearer when we put them in their proper context. The <em>Phenomenology</em> was the first text of Hegel’s split with Schelling, and its central concept of spirit is crucial to this split and to Hegel’s attempt to render himself independent from Schelling. In his works at the start of the nineteenth century (which are now understood to be his <em>early</em> works), Schelling emphasises life, organicism, and – most especially – <em>nature</em> in his account of the absolute. As Frederick Beiser writes, Schelling got close to ‘virtually equating the standpoint of absolute identity with nature itself.’<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> However, this led to Schelling taking a quasi-Romantic stance towards the absolute – in this view, absolute truth can only be expressed artistically or poetically. Philosophy must begin, Schelling claims, with an ‘utterly nonobjective principle’ which cannot be ‘apprehended through concepts.’<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Such a principle, he argues, can be intuited only artistically; ‘The work of art merely reflects to me what is otherwise not reflected by anything, namely that absolutely identical which has already divided itself even in the self.’<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Schelling’s view is that philosophy, being a form of thought and therefore based in concepts and distinctions, cannot represent nature in its absolute unity; rather, this unity can only be intuited by artistic means. This is precisely Hegel’s problem with Schelling; we might imagine that, when Hegel refers to philosophers who ‘take what thought has torn asunder and then stir it all together into a smooth mélange’ and who merely ‘fabricate the feeling of the essence’ of reality, he is referring not only to the Romantics but also to Schelling’s <em>Naturphilosophie</em> with its insistence on an unconscious, pre- (and indeed anti-) conceptual ‘nature’.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> In Schellingian <em>Naturphilosophie</em>, Hegel argues, we find that ‘spirit has shown itself to be so impoverished that it seems to yearn for its refreshment only in the meagre feeling of divinity.’<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The second problem for Hegel is that Schelling’s insistence on <em>unity</em>, on nature/absolute as the pure identity of identity, results in an emptied-out philosophy that has no room for the qualitative difference that self-consciousness, society, and so on are characterised by. In Schelling’s words, ‘Absolute identity <em>simply is</em> and is as certain as the proposition A = A is.’<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Considered from the viewpoint of <em>absolute truth</em>, therefore, A = A is the most accurate – in fact, the <em>only</em> – description of reality; ‘there is no difference, distinction, or multiplicity in that dark night’, as Beiser writes.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> This ‘night’ is precisely what Hegel takes issue with, for how can an unconscious darkness of pure identity give rise to the ‘self-originating, self-differentiating wealth of shapes’ that philosophy is supposed to comprehend?<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Accordingly, Hegel famously regards the absolute of <em>Naturphilosophie</em> as ‘the night in which all cows are black’: from the viewpoint of the Schellingian absolute, everything is reduced to sameness, and nothing beside remains.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Given that Hegel was something of a Schellingian for some time, it seems that he regarded <em>Naturphilosophie</em> as one of the most sophisticated attempts at conceiving the absolute as a <em>substance</em> (nature, in this case) – and not as <em>subject</em>, as Fichte had done. Schelling had gone further than Fichte, but nonetheless arrived at a dead end. Therefore, Hegel’s project to overcome Schelling was to conceive of something ‘higher’ than nature, which avoids the two problems outlined above: that is, something which is both accessible to consciousness and allows for qualitative difference. ‘The originality of Hegel’s thought’, Hyppolite writes, ‘does not lie in its concept of Life but in the philosophical attempt to conceptualize life by means of a dialectic which permits “finite determinations” to be engulfed in [but not erased by] “the indifferent”.’<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> This conception of life is spirit. Spirit (when fully actualised through its self-understanding) is absolute reality <em>aware of itself as both substance and subject</em>. Being self-understanding, and thereby incorporating subjectivity and negativity, it makes sense that spirit is a notion that serves philosophy better than nature with all its quiet stillness. But what does it mean to say that spirit is ‘higher’ than nature?</p>
<p>In an 1802 work on natural law, Hegel claims that nature is merely the ‘acutality’ – the manifestation – of the absolute, while spirit is both the manifestation <em>and</em> the <em>reflection</em> of the absolute into itself: ‘the recovery of the universe into itself.’<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> When something is reflected into itself (that is, when it becomes capable of understanding itself), it does not become something entirely different; as such, it would be a mistake to understand spirit as something <em>supernatural</em>, utterly ‘beyond’ nature. Rather, it is ‘higher’ than nature insofar as it is more <em>developed</em>; it is able to give an explicit account for itself while nature remains dormant, waiting to be interpreted by something outside of itself.</p>
