<h3 id="prelude">Prelude</h3>
<h4 id="history-in-the-phenomenology">History in the
<em>Phenomenology</em></h4>
<p>According to György Lukács, in the <em>Phenomenology</em> the
entirety of human history (up to 1807, at least) is ‘traversed <em>three
times</em>’.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Using the terms that Hegel adopts
later in the <em>Encyclopaedia</em>, Lukács considers these three
repetitions to be concerned with <em>subjective spirit</em>,
<em>objective spirit</em>, and finally <em>absolute spirit</em>. The
first part covers the development of <em>thought</em> throughout
history, from sensuous certainty to law-testing reason. The second part,
which consists only of the chapter on <em>Spirit</em>, repeats this
historical account from the perspective of the objective – social –
context in which thought takes place. Finally, in the chapters on
<em>Religion</em> and <em>Absolute Knowing</em>, we arrive at an
absolute standpoint where the whole of history can be surveyed at once
and the ‘laws <em>governing the movement</em> of history’ or ‘the
dialectics of reality’ can be comprehended.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In
this interpretation, the <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> is literally a
history book; sensuous certainty is understood to be chronologically
prior to perception, phrenology is understood as a successor (at least
indirectly) to Baconian science, and so on.</p>
<p>This view of Hegel’s book is not very popular anymore. For a start,
if Hegel were really trying to write a history, he would have made some
significant errors: for example, the unhappy consciousness he describes
quite early in the book exhibits a religious alienation (separation from
God) that has manifested <em>throughout</em> history, in some cases
after Hegel’s death (for example, in Kierkegaard). And although there
are some coincidental accuracies in the ordering of positions
(Augustine, for example, was a skeptic before he was an unhappy
Christian, just like the <em>Phenomenology</em>’s protagonist), they are
outnumbered by the <em>in</em>accuracies (in Hegel’s narrative, stoicism
precedes skepticism; in Greece, Pyrrho preceded Zeno). However, these
points could be interpreted as signs that Hegel merely wrote a
<em>bad</em> history – not that he didn’t intend to write a history at
all. Michael N. Forster defends Lukács’s reading on the basis of certain
remarks that Hegel himself makes:<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The series of the figurations of consciousness which consciousness
traverses on this path is the <strong>full history</strong> of the
<em>cultivation</em> of consciousness into science.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Only the whole spirit is in time, and the shapes, which are shapes of
the whole <em>spirit</em> as such, exhibit themselves <strong>in a
sequence</strong> [<em>Aufeinanderfolger</em>], one after the other.<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it really the case, however, that ‘history’ or ‘sequence’ in this
sense necessarily refers to the <em>actual</em> history of humanity, in
the precise order that it took place? It is more accurate to think of
the <em>Phenomenology</em> as a narrative of the development of thought
(and subjectivity, society, and so on) that <em>takes the shape of a
history</em> but is not itself directly correspondent with ‘real’
history. In what we have read so far, the concrete historical phenomena
named by Hegel have only been <em>examples of manifestations</em> of
particular shapes of consciousness, and this is wholly distinct from
them <em>being</em> these shapes exactly. Hegel acknowledges this
explicitly when he writes in the <em>Self-Consciousness</em> chapter:
‘As it has consciously appeared in the history of spirit, this freedom
of self-consciousness has, as is well known, been called
<em>stoicism</em>.’<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The ‘real’ stoicism – that is, the
movement elaborated by Zeno, Seneca, and so on – is simply one
‘conscious appearance’ in history of what Hegel is talking about (albeit
a particularly prominent appearance). The narrative depicted in the
<em>Phenomenology</em> is thus a possible manifestation of the
development of consciousness – a development whose stages manifest in
contingent ways but is nonetheless governed by the necessity of
logic.</p>
<p>With that being said, it is nonetheless the case that the chapters on
<em>Spirit</em> and <em>Religion</em> are more consciously informed by
‘real’ history. We will see in <em>Spirit</em>, for example, that the
Enlightenment reaches its truth in a revolution which eventually
culminates in ‘terror’ – and this, of course, is precisely what happened
in Europe at the turn of the nineteenth century. This relates to what
Lukács got <em>right</em> about the structure of the
<em>Phenomenology</em>: namely, that it is in the <em>Spirit</em>
chapter that the history of society is foregrounded, no longer a
‘shadowy, enigmatic backcloth’ for the development of
<em>individual</em> consciousness, but rather ‘a coherent rational
order’ that allows us to comprehend ‘the rise of modern civil society’
(which, according to Lukács, is Hegel’s central preoccupation).<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="from">From Nature to Spirit</h4>
<p>As such, we are now at the moment where spirit comes to the
foreground of Hegel’s focus. Given the title of the book – the
<em>Phenomenology of</em> <strong><em>Spirit</em></strong> – we can be
forgiven for being surprised that it has taken so long for this to
happen. We might be especially surprised, given that the concept of
‘spirit’, though it has been used quite a few times, is still without a
concrete definition. Nonetheless, we can find some clarifications by
looking back to the preface. In §25, Hegel makes two important remarks:
firstly, ‘That the true is only actual as a system, or, that substance
is essentially subject, is expressed in the representation that
expresses the absolute as <em>spirit</em>.’ Secondly, ‘Spirit knowing
itself as spirit is <em>science</em>. Science is its actuality.’ What
are we to make of this? For a start, Hegel seems to suggest that in
order for us to achieve philosophy’s goal of conceiving the true (or the
absolute) not just as substance but also as subject, we must express the
absolute ‘as <em>spirit</em>.’<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Secondly, spirit
<em>is</em> – it achieves its actuality – through knowing itself, and
this self-knowledge is what Hegel calls ‘science’, or systematic
philosophy. Consequently, we can take from these remarks that, for
philosophy to rise from ‘the love of knowing’ to ‘actual knowing’ (§5),
we must conceive of the absolute as something that comes to understand
itself and that, through this process of self-interpretation, also
becomes more actualised.</p>
<p>This seems still quite abstract, however, and it leaves us with a
rather general and unhelpful definition of ‘spirit’ (as ‘that which is
actualised through its self-interpretation’). Things become clearer when
we put them in their proper context. The <em>Phenomenology</em> was the
first text of Hegel’s split with Schelling, and its central concept of
spirit is crucial to this split and to Hegel’s attempt to render himself
independent from Schelling. In his works at the start of the nineteenth
century (which are now understood to be his <em>early</em> works),
Schelling emphasises life, organicism, and – most especially –
<em>nature</em> in his account of the absolute. As Frederick Beiser
writes, Schelling got close to ‘virtually equating the standpoint of
absolute identity with nature itself.’<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
However, this led to Schelling taking a quasi-Romantic stance towards
the absolute – that is, a view wherein absolute truth can only be
expressed artistically or poetically. Philosophy must begin, Schelling
claims, with an ‘utterly nonobjective principle’ which cannot be
‘apprehended through concepts.’<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Such a principle, he
argues, can be intuited only artistically; ‘The work of art merely
reflects to me what is otherwise not reflected by anything, namely that
absolutely identical which has already divided itself even in the
self.’<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Schelling’s view is that
philosophy, being a form of thought and therefore based in concepts and
distinctions, cannot represent nature in its absolute unity; rather,
this unity can only be intuited by artistic means. This is precisely
Hegel’s problem with Schelling; we might imagine that, when Hegel refers
to philosophers who ‘take what thought has torn asunder and then stir it
all together into a smooth mélange’ and who merely ‘fabricate the
feeling of the essence’ of reality, he is referring not only to the
Romantics but also to Schelling’s <em>Naturphilosophie</em> with its
insistence on an unconscious, pre- (and indeed anti-) conceptual
‘nature’.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> In Schellingian
<em>Naturphilosophie</em>, Hegel argues, we find that ‘spirit has shown
itself to be so impoverished that it seems to yearn for its refreshment
only in the meagre feeling of divinity.’<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The second problem for Hegel is that Schelling’s insistence on
<em>unity</em>, on nature/absolute as the pure identity of identity,
results in an emptied-out philosophy that has no room for the
qualitative difference that self-consciousness, society, and so on are
characterised by. In Schelling’s words, ‘Absolute identity <em>simply
is</em> and is as certain as the proposition A = A is.’<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
Considered from the viewpoint of <em>absolute truth</em>, therefore, A =
A is the most accurate – in fact, the <em>only</em> – description of
reality; ‘there is no difference, distinction, or multiplicity in that
dark night’, as Beiser writes.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> This ‘night’ is
precisely what Hegel takes issue with, for how can an unconscious
darkness of pure identity give rise to the ‘self-originating,
self-differentiating wealth of shapes’ that philosophy is supposed to
comprehend?<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Accordingly, Hegel famously regards
the absolute of <em>Naturphilosophie</em> as ‘the night in which all
cows are black’: from the viewpoint of the Schellingian absolute,
everything is reduced to sameness, and nothing beside remains.<a
href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Given that Hegel was something of a Schellingian for some time, it
seems that he regarded <em>Naturphilosophie</em> as one of the most
sophisticated attempts at conceiving the absolute as a
<em>substance</em> (nature, in this case) – and not as <em>subject</em>,
as Fichte had done. Schelling had gone further than Fichte, but
nonetheless arrived at a dead end. Therefore, Hegel’s project to
overcome Schelling was to conceive of something ‘higher’ than nature,
which avoids the two problems outlined above: that is, something which
is both accessible to consciousness and allows for qualitative
difference. ‘The originality of Hegel’s thought’, Hyppolite writes,
‘does not lie in its concept of Life but in the philosophical attempt to
conceptualize life by means of a dialectic which permits “finite
determinations” to be engulfed in [but not erased by] “the
indifferent”.’<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> This conception of life is spirit.
Spirit (when fully actualised through its self-understanding) is
absolute reality <em>aware of itself as both substance and subject</em>.
Being self-understanding, and thereby incorporating subjectivity and
negativity, it makes sense that spirit is a notion that serves
philosophy better than nature with all its quiet stillness. But what
does it mean to say that spirit is ‘higher’ than nature?</p>
<p>In an 1802 work on natural law, Hegel claims that nature is merely
the ‘actuality’ – the manifestation – of the absolute, while spirit is
both the manifestation <em>and</em> the <em>reflection</em> of the
absolute into itself: ‘the recovery of the universe into itself.’<a
href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> When something is reflected into
itself (that is, when it becomes capable of understanding itself), it
does not become something entirely different; as such, it would be a
mistake to understand spirit as something <em>supernatural</em>, utterly
‘beyond’ nature. Rather, it is ‘higher’ than nature insofar as it is
more <em>developed</em>; it is able to give an explicit account for
itself while nature remains dormant, waiting to be interpreted by
something outside of itself. When Kant, in his <em>Anthropology</em>,
claims that ‘physiological’ knowledge is the knowledge ‘of <em>what
nature makes of the human being</em>’, and ‘pragmatic’ knowledge is of
‘what he as a free-acting being <em>makes of himself</em>’, he
unknowingly anticipates Hegel’s emphasis on the spiritual dimension of
human life as something more developed than the natural dimension.<a
href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> As we will see, the chapter on
spirit features repeated triumphs of spirit (in the form of culture,
universality, and so on) over the simplicity of nature, right from the
start.</p>
<h4 id="anot">Another Beginning</h4>
<p>Rational consciousness promised itself that it was ‘all reality’,
‘all truth’; however, being uncomprehending of its place in society and
history, this promise is nothing more than a naïve assertion.<a
href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> For spirit, however, ‘the certainty
of being all reality has been elevated to truth.’<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
Note that it would be inaccurate to refer to ‘spiritual consciousness’
in the way that we refer to ‘rational consciousness’, precisely because
spirit inherently belongs to a <em>collective</em> in a way that reason
does not.</p>
<p>In the opening paragraph to the chapter on Spirit, Hegel refers to
observing reason. The <em>truth</em> of observation, he claims – that
is, the ultimate outcome of its internal logic – is the
<em>sublation</em> of an ‘immediate instinct for finding, the sublation
of this <em>unconscious existence</em> of the truth.’<a href="#fn23"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
What does he mean by this? Recall that the conclusion of observing
reason was: ‘spirit is a bone.’<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> The ‘sublation’ of
this insane statement is how, eventually (after a detour in the
‘Actualisation’ chapter into the origins of sociality), the ‘truth’ of
spirit emerges from its ‘unconscious existence’. A sublation
(<em>Aufhebung</em>) is a double (or ‘determinate’) negation. The first
moment in the sublation of ‘spirit is a bone’ is immediate incredulity:
<em>of course</em> this statement is false, ‘spirit’ and ‘bone’
completely contradict one another! The second moment is the truly
Hegelian moment, where negativity is itself negated into a positive:
spirit <em>is</em> this contradiction… Spirit is that element of human
existence which cannot be found in the dead nature of a bone; it is in
its spiritual existence that human society is ‘higher’ than nature. Put
more concisely: spirit is that in virtue of which I am more than what I
am made of, more than the sum of my parts.</p>
<p>‘All the previous shapes of consciousness are abstractions from <a
href="#begin">spirit</a>’, according to Hegel.<a href="#fn25"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
As such, and as mentioned above, spirit is often present
<em>implicitly</em> or in the background of the <em>Phenomenology</em>’s
earlier stages. For instance, the ‘ethical substance’ we saw in Reason
is accordingly brought now to self-awareness, and becomes ‘<em>ethical
actuality</em>’.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The present chapter is therefore a
step forwards and a step backwards: literally we (the phenomenological
observers) go ‘back in time’ to the Greece of Sophocles, but we do this
with a uniquely <em>modern</em> capacity for critical reason. Harris
explains this perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not Sophocles, or even Plato, who are “more advanced” than
Kant. It is rather we who, because we stand upon Kant’s shoulders, can
see and why the Hellenism of Schiller and Hölderlin is an advance over
Kant. Kant knew more than anyone had ever known before him. But he knew
it all “falsely”, because he did not grasp that a rational order must
uncritically <em>be</em>, before anyone can critically “have” Reason at
all.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is in this sense that Hegel begins with a return to the ancient
world in this chapter, not because he glorifies it as a lost, perfect
society, but because it was a society of the ‘unwritten law’ which,
demanding interpretation, gives rise to authentic ethical life, as
opposed to the mere maxim-testing of Kantian morality.</p>
<p>Before he begins the analysis of ancient spirit, Hegel gives a short
summary of the whole forthcoming chapter: firstly, spirit is present
only abstractly or immediately, as ‘the formal universality of law.’<a
href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> Through the eventual ‘estrangement’
(alienation) of people from this law, we witness the stage of
‘<em>cultural formation</em>’ (<em>Bildung</em>) which, at its climactic
moment, undergoes a ‘revolution’ and gives rise to the Enlightenment. In
the Enlightenment, Hegel claims, ‘the <em>conscience</em> of spirit’
becomes aware of itself, and gives form to a system of morality,
comparable to but nonetheless more sophisticated than the quasi-Kantian
system we have already seen. For now, however, this long journey begins
with Sophocles’ <em>Antigone</em> and the ‘ethical life’ which it
represents.</p>
<p>(Since Hegel is not engaged in a literary analysis of
<em>Antigone</em>, and is merely interested in using the play as an
illustration for his ideas, a short summary of the story is enough to
understand his references to it. Antigone is the main character; she is
the daughter of Oedipus, the dead king, and is mourning the death of her
brothers Polynices and Eteocles, who died fighting each other. Creon,
the new king of Thebes, has honoured Eteocles and consequently decided
that Polynices is to be shamed and given no proper burial. Antigone, out
of a sense of familial duty, opts to become ‘a pious criminal’ by
burying her brother against Creon’s demands. She is consequently
sentenced to death by Creon, and is buried alive. She hangs herself in
the cave. Creon’s son, Haemon, loved Antigone and is so upset at Creon’s
decision (and Antigone’s suicide) that he too kills himself, which
causes Creon to condemn himself with grief and guilt.)</p>
<h3 id="true">True Spirit, Ethical Life</h3>
<p>As I have mentioned in my introduction, many of Hegel’s
contemporaries idolised ancient Greece. In his own way, Hegel did as
well; however, he attributed more discordance to Greek society than
writers like Goethe, Schiller, or Winckelmann were willing to. In the
present chapter (‘True Spirit, Ethical Life’), Hegel first analyses the
harmonious dimension of ancient Greece (in the section ‘The Ethical
World, the Human and Divine Law, Man and Woman’) – this is the dimension
of Greece that his contemporaries admired. Secondly, however (in the
section entitled ‘Ethical Action, Human and Divine Knowing, Guilt and
Fate’), Hegel finds a disruption of this harmony which, he argues, the
Greek tragedians were the first to recognise. In this way, Hegel is not
as dogmatic a philhellene as some of his contemporaries were.</p>
<h4 id="dead">The Burial of the Dead</h4>
<p>Aristotle argues that, in the study of ethics, ‘we must begin with
things known to us’.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> The ‘starting points’ of ethical
reflection, according to Aristotle, originate in the habits we acquire
in our upbringing; in other words, to study ethics, one must first have
some ethical background on which to reflect. Ethical substance, which
has not yet been raised to the self-awareness of ethical
<em>actuality</em>, is that background in the stage of ‘ethical life’.
Ethical life (<em>Sittlichkeit</em>) is for Hegel the stage in a
society’s history where people do not fully acknowledge their
participation as constituents of ethical substance; rather, they simply
contemplate it as what is ‘there’.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> In this sense, Harris
argues, ethical life is akin to unhappy consciousness insofar as it is
not really <em>self</em>-consciousness but is instead a mere ‘awareness’
of some <em>other</em> (namely, the ethical substance).<a href="#fn31"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In other words, the structure of ethical life – which we call
<em>law</em> – appears to the citizen of ethical life as an immediate
<em>given</em>. What is essential for Hegel, however, is that it is a
<em>split</em> given: spirit ‘descends upon us’ in two ways, two kinds
of law. Firstly, as a ‘natural ethical’ phenomenon, it is given as
‘<strong>divine law</strong>’ into which one is born as a person qua
<em>natural being</em>: a law which is manifested in family ties.<a
href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> Hegel’s idea here is that the
natural (that is, biological) relations between family members give rise
to certain ethical obligations and duties that family members owe one
another. This dimension of the law emphasises <em>individuality</em>;
the family is (for Hegel) a private community separated from the
universality of public life. The second kind of law concerns this
universality: it is the ‘familiarly known’ law, the legal system into
which one is born as a person qua <em>citizen</em>. Hegel calls this
‘<strong>human law</strong>’; it is determined and enforced by ‘the
government’.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>The relation between these two spheres of ethical life is crucial for
Hegel. First of al, the divine law of the family and the existence of
oneself as a family member is more immediate than one’s status as a
citizen. I consciously carry out my citizenship, and it can be debated
and determined by the state (think of refugees, for example), but on the
other hand I <em>immediately am</em> in a family, among ‘unblemished
heavenly shapes’ of ‘unprofaned innocence’, without any conscious effort
required on my part.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> Divine law is intuitive, Hegel
argues, and ‘does not lie in the daylight of consciousness.’<a
href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Nonetheless, it has a close
relation to the human law of the public sphere. Though the family
emerges in the domain of nature and the individual, its <em>ethical</em>
dimension is concerned with culture and the universal – because ‘the
ethical is in itself universal.’<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> For Hegel, this means
that love and sentiment have no relevance to the family as an ethical
structure, because love is ‘natural’ and not ethical. Rather, the
ethical purpose of the family is not to love and care for one another,
but to allow one’s family members to break out of the family and into
culture and the public sphere. Family duty ‘consists in taking the
singular individual out of the family, in subjugating his naturalness
and individuality, and thus in leading him towards <em>virtue</em>,
towards a life lived in and for the universal.’<a href="#fn37"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
As such, Hegel thinks that the function of the family is to undermine
the family; family ties are created so that they can be left behind.</p>
<p>There is, however, a second duty for the family which is ‘positive’
rather than ‘negative’. The family’s positive duty is towards the family
member who, ‘out of the long progression of his dispersed existence, is
condensed into one completed shape’: that is, the individual who has
died.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> In performing a proper burial for
the dead, the family resists the deceased’s dissolution into nature: by
mourning, the dead individual is reasserted – ‘saved’ – as a universal
being. As Hegel understands it, the Greeks practiced burial rites
because they interpreted human life as always already ethical; natural
existence (and natural relations like those of the family) must be taken
as embodying ethical norms. Burial is the divine law’s way of
maintaining the spiritual existence of an individual. But this
maintenance can also come from the spiritual realm itself, the realm of
human law and government. As an example, Hegel points out the frequency
of warfare in ancient Greece: Greek war, he claims, was a way of making
men ‘feel the power of their lord and master, death’, and preventing
them from falling back into their ‘mere’ natural existence.<a
href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>In the domain of both human law (war) and divine law (burial),
<em>death</em> is the crucial moment in determining an individual’s
ethical status. When an individual dies in vain, or dies without being
mourned, their universal (ethical) dimension is destroyed as they become
absorbed by nature; if, however, they die for a ‘cause’, or their death
is properly mourned, then the ethical community ‘supplements the
abstract natural movement by adding to it the movement of consciousness,
by <em>interrupting nature’s work</em>, and by wresting the
blood-relation away from destruction.’<a href="#fn40"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Following this, Hegel turns back to family relations and their
spiritual significance – or, indeed, <em>in</em>significance: Hegel’s
analysis of the family is particularly cold and dismissive of familial
love and care. The specific picture of a family that he analyses is
strictly heterosexual and is oriented almost totally to the purpose of
having children. He starts, therefore, with the relationship between a
husband and wife. This relationship, Hegel claims, is ‘only the
<em>representation</em> and <em>picture</em> of spirit’; it does not
have significant spiritual value because the recognition between a
husband and wife is ‘natural’ (that is, romantic and emotional) rather
than ethical. Furthermore, he argues, the actuality of a marital
relationship is external to the relationship itself – the relationship
is actualised in the child. Hegel even claims that, with the birth of
the child, the purpose of the marital relationship is achieved and the
relationship consequently becomes obsolete (‘disappears’).<a

role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> This is presumably what Beauvoir is
thinking of when she repeatedly attributes to Hegel the idea that ‘the
birth of children is the death of parents.’<a href="#fn42"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>What about the relationship between parent and child? This also is
too impure for Hegel. Firstly, again, it is ‘affected by emotion’ (Hegel
does not use the word ‘love’ to identify this emotion, but instead
describes it as the parent’s awareness that the child symbolises the
actuality of their marital relationship); secondly, the child – despite
being the ultimate product of the parents’ relationship – attains their
own being-for-itself, their own autonomy, and becomes ‘an alien
actuality’ to their parents, undermining any sense of harmony in the
family. Likewise, the child’s relationship to their parent is impure
because they are aware of the ‘vanishing’ of their parents’ marital
relationship. This is an awareness that is brought onto the child ‘only
through the separation from their origin’, that is, through the precise
separation that Freud would also eventually identify as constitutive of
human mental life.</p>
