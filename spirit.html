<h4 class="subtitle" id="on-history-in-the-phenomenology">on History in the <em>Phenomenology</em></h4>
<p>According to György Lukács, in the <em>Phenomenology</em> the entirety of human history (up to 1807, at least) is ‘traversed <em>three times</em>’.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Using the terms that Hegel adopts later in the <em>Encyclopaedia</em>, Lukács considers these three repetitions to be concerned with <em>subjective spirit</em>, <em>objective spirit</em>, and finally <em>absolute spirit</em>. The first part covers the development of <em>thought</em> throughout history, from sensuous certainty to law-testing reason. The second part, which consists only of the chapter on <em>Spirit</em>, repeats this historical account from the perspective of the objective – social – context in which thought takes place. Finally, in the chapters on <em>Religion</em> and <em>Absolute Knowing</em>, we arrive at an absolute standpoint where the whole of history can be surveyed at once and the ‘laws <em>governing the movement</em> of history’ or ‘the dialectics of reality’ can be comprehended.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In this interpretation, the <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> is literally a history book; sensuous certainty is understood to be chronologically prior to perception, phrenology is understood as a successor (at least indirectly) to Baconian science, and so on.</p>
<p>This view of Hegel’s book is not very popular anymore. For a start, if Hegel were really trying to write a history, he would have made some significant errors: for example, the unhappy consciousness he describes quite early in the book exhibits a religious alienation (separation from God) that has manifested <em>throughout</em> history, in some cases after Hegel’s death (for example, in Kierkegaard). And although there are some coincidental accuracies in the ordering of positions (Augustine, for example, was a skeptic before he was an unhappy Christian, just like the <em>Phenomenology</em>’s protagonist), they are outnumbered by the <em>in</em>accuracies (in Hegel’s narrative, stoicism precedes skepticism; in Greece, Pyrrho preceded Zeno). However, these points could be interpreted as signs that Hegel merely wrote a <em>bad</em> history – not that he didn’t intend to write a history at all. Michael N. Forster defends Lukács’s reading on the basis of certain remarks that Hegel himself makes:<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The series of the figurations of consciousness which consciousness traverses on this path is the <strong>full history</strong> of the <em>cultivation</em> of consciousness into science.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Only the whole spirit is in time, and the shapes, which are shapes of the whole <em>spirit</em> as such, exhibit themselves <strong>in a sequence</strong> [<em>Aufeinanderfolger</em>], one after the other.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it really the case, however, that ‘history’ or ‘sequence’ in this sense necessarily refers to the <em>actual</em> history of humanity, in the precise order that it took place? It is more accurate to think of the <em>Phenomenology</em> as a narrative of the development of thought (and subjectivity, society, and so on) that <em>takes the shape of a history</em> but is not itself directly correspondent with ‘real’ history. In what we have read so far, the concrete historical phenomena named by Hegel have only been <em>examples of manifestations</em> of particular shapes of consciousness, and this is wholly distinct from them <em>being</em> these shapes exactly. Hegel acknowledges this explicitly when he writes in the <em>Self-Consciousness</em> chapter: ‘As it has consciously appeared in the history of spirit, this freedom of self-consciousness has, as is well known, been called <em>stoicism</em>.’<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The ‘real’ stoicism – that is, the movement elaborated by Zeno, Seneca, and so on – is simply one ‘conscious appearance’ in history of what Hegel is talking about (albeit a particularly prominent appearance). The narrative depicted in the <em>Phenomenology</em> is thus a possible manifestation of the development of consciousness – a development whose stages manifest in contingent ways but is nonetheless governed by the necessity of logic.</p>
<p>With that being said, it is nonetheless the case that the chapters on <em>Spirit</em> and <em>Religion</em> are more consciously informed by ‘real’ history. We will see in <em>Spirit</em>, for example, that the Enlightenment reaches its truth in a revolution which eventually culminates in ‘terror’ – and this, of course, is precisely what happened in Europe at the turn of the nineteenth century. This relates to what Lukács got <em>right</em> about the structure of the <em>Phenomenology</em>: namely, that it is in the <em>Spirit</em> chapter that the history of society is foregrounded, no longer a ‘shadowy, enigmatic backcloth’ for the development of <em>individual</em> consciousness, but rather ‘a coherent rational order’ that allows us to comprehend ‘the rise of modern civil society’ (which, according to Lukács, is Hegel’s central preoccupation).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
