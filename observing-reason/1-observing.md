## Reason

### Observing Reason

This first of three major sections of the *Phenomenology*'s epic account of
Reason is the rational consciousness's first attempt to 'raise its certainty
into truth, and to fulfill the empty mine.'[^1] The abstractions of the Kantian
and Fichtean systems are to be overcome: now, reason wants to really reach into
the world and understand it for itself. The world is no longer a simple object
to be hopelessly grasped, as it was for consciousness (in sensuous certainty,
perception, and so on). Instead, in Jean Hyppolite's words, this braver stage of
reason 'is interested not in the sensuous as such but in the concept that
resides in the sensuous.'[^2] By *thinking* through nature and the sensuous
world, understanding it as *inherently conceptual*, reason will find itself in
the world. Whereas, in the stages of consciousness, the subject was content to
merely stand before the world, naïvely 'taking it in', it has now developed the
capacity to *reach out* to the world, *will* itself towards knowing it, and so
on. This is what permits the earlier summary of Reason as the stage at which the
subject's activity is defined by *mediation*. The opening paragraph of
*Observing Reason* is remarkably clear, and contains multiple clues for how this
mediating relationship with the world will play out:

> Formerly, it just happened to consciousness that it perceived and
> *experienced* quite a bit in the thing; however, here it itself makes the
> observations and engages the experience. ... Reason thus now has a universal
> *interest* in the world because it is the certainty of having its present
> moment in the world, or is certain that the present is rational. It seeks its
> other, while knowing that it possesses nothing else in that other but itself;
> it seeks only its own infinity.[^3]

Of course, the *Phenomenology* is ultimately populated by a sequence of
*failures*; consequently, in the very next paragraph, Hegel explains how
observing reason will eventually fall. Its goal, as we have established, is to
*engage* the world, mediate between subject and nature, and thereby feel at home
in the world, and *among* the world: that is, to not be an individual
abstraction, as the I of Kant and Fichte was. However,

> if reason rummages around through all the innards of things, and opens all
> their veins so that reason might encounter itself gushing out from them, then
> it will have no luck; rather, it must at an earlier point have perfected
> itself inwardly in order to be able to experience its perfection.[^4]

In other words, the observer (this is the name I will give to our current
character) will eventually come to find that it cannot find itself in the world
of things while it still has an underdeveloped notion of its own selfhood. Or,
as Kalkavage puts it, 'thinghood as observation conceives it (thinghood as
nature) is an inappropriate vessel for the self, whose true nature observing
reason does not know.'[^5] When this 'vessel' proves to be insufficient, reason
will turn to the *practical* realm of 'self-actualisation' in order to know
itself. Hegel makes this point himself, when he introduces the three divisions
of *Observing Reason*, and gives a clue to what follows them:

> What observing reason is doing is to be examined in the moments of its
> movement as it incorporates nature, spirit, and, finally, the relation of both
> as sensuous being, and when as an existing actuality, it seeks itself.[^6]

#### Observation of Nature {#natur}

At the outset, the observer thinks in the tradition of Francis Bacon, working as
an 'unthinking consciousness.' Hegel does not mean this in a straightforwardly
disparaging way; rather, he means that the observer is engaged in a naïve kind
of empiricism, which deludes itself into thinking that it relies on observation
-- 'tasting, smelling, feeling, hearing, and seeing' -- alone.[^7] The naïvety
of this position is that it has forgotten the role that consciousness plays in
determining the objects of experience. As Kant wrote in his *Prolegomena*, a
'given intuition must be subsumed under a concept which determines the form of
judging in general' in order to count as *experience* and actually contribute to
our knowledge of the world.[^8] The observer cannot simply sit and gaze at the
world if it wishes to actually observe it. An empiricist like Bacon thus
undermines the role that thought (or, for Kant, the understanding specifically)
plays in their observation of the world. This consciousness is 'unthinking' in
the sense that it represses its own thought. (Think also of Hume's denial of the
substantial self, on the basis of it not showing up as an impression). To
illustrate this point simply, we know, since the passage from sensuous certainty
to perception, that any attempt at grasping a sensuous *this* always gives way
to an unintended universal. Hegel makes the same point again here: 'the meaning
of what is perceived should at least be that of a *universal*, not a *sensuous
this*.'

At first, this universal is just what consciousness finds to be stable in the
movement of the observed world. As a cloud floats through the sky, slowly
undulating into different shapes, I nonetheless recognise that it is the same
cloud, 'the uniform repetition of the same *doing*.' At this stage, I have this
recognition because I -- the observer -- have a **memory** of the cloud's
movement and transformation, and through my memories of it, I can identify what
remains. This memory is what serves as the universal. As such, Hegel explains,
the observer 'must shift the responsibility to *itself* for the real movement of
the universal.'[^9] That is, universality on this account belongs only to the
observer's *description* of the world, 'without the sensuous having in itself
become a universal.' The problem with this is captured by Hegel's phrase, 'the
indeterminateness of the universal': when it is up to me and my memory to
identify universals in things, there is no criterion *in the things* for how
these universals are identified. Amid the wealth of the observable universe, how
are the lines between discrete 'things' to be drawn? The observer is left with
an 'endless *particularization* of the chaotic range of animals and plants,
mountain ranges, metals, earth, etc.'[^10] Within this 'inexhaustible supply for
observing and describing', the observer can hypothetically go on classifying
forever. By use of its memory, it can take anything to be a universal; as such,
'it can no longer know whether what seems to have being in itself is not a
contingency.'[^11]

In this overwhelming and endless game of classification, the observer comes
across a sign that it has not 'advance[d] into *sensuous perceiving*'.
Specifically, the observing consciousness ends up with a distinction between
'what enables things to be *known*' -- that is, the aspects of observed objects
that end up in the memory, ready to be classed as universals -- and 'the
left-over range of sensuous properties, something which the thing itself cannot
do without but from which consciousness exempts itself.'[^12] This distinction
essentially gives us another form of the thing-in-itself: this time, in
Kalkavage's words, consciousness 'is aware that its ideas may be no more than
mental constructs.'[^13] It is able to recognise the difference between the
essential and inessential aspects of a thing, but with this recognition comes
also a 'wavering back and forth about whether what is essential and necessary
for *cognition* can also be said to be in *the things*.'[^14] This is a major
problem for a rational observer, who is so preoccupied with finding reason
not just within themselves but also within the world.

Consequently, observing reason quickly looks for a solution to this 'wavering'.
In this search, it realises that anything that is cognised as 'essential' can
only be cognised as such if it counts as 'that through which [things] *break
free* from the universal continuity of being as such, *cut* themselves *loose*
from others, and be *for themselves*.'[^15] That is, if a thing is recognised by
consciousness as a distinct 'thing' at all, it must be thanks to certain
elements of that thing which, regardless of any observation, make the thing
distinct among the rest of the world (or, what Hegel elegantly calls 'the
universal continuity of being'). In still other words, that which separates an
object to the observer must have already separated the object *from other
objects*. In illustrating this point, Hegel turns to the example of taxonomy,
where he clearly has Linnaeus in mind:

> The distinguishing marks of animals, for example, are taken from their claws
> and teeth. Indeed, not only does cognition *distinguish* one animal from
> another by this means, but it is by these means that the animal itself
> *separates* itself off from others. It is through these weapons that it
> preserves itself *for itself* and keeps itself detached from the
> universal.[^16]

Now, Hegel realises that not all objects are animals; that is, not all objects
'get as far' as *being-for-themselves*. Plants have no 'intention' or will to
survive; the only 'distinguishing marks' that Hegel finds in them arise from
their '*dividing themselves in two*' in sexual differentiation.[^17] This limit
in distinction, he explains, is what makes plants harder *for us* to distinguish
from one another, in comparison to animals. However, 'at an even lower level' --
i.e., the level of chemical objects -- things make no 'effort' to distinguish
themselves at all; often, they dissolve into one another and change form
constantly. Such an object 'cannot itself any longer differentiate itself from
an other'. It is seemingly a different thing when it is '*motionless*' to when
it is '*in relationships*'; in this difference, we see the world of constant
flux that Heraclitus described. Accordingly, the wavering question -- of whether
our cognition is really grasping what the observed objects *actually are* --
arises again. There is movement in the world that the observer's account of
universals cannot account for. A memory does not move.

The only way to overcome this problem is to form a new account of the universal
-- one which won't hope for '*inert* determinateness', but instead will expect
precisely what it sees in the observed world: that is, the *shifting* of
determinacy. The truth of determinateness, Hegel explains, is '*its relating
itself to its opposite*.'[^18] The 'instinct of reason' pushes the observer now
to look not merely for 'determinatenesses' in the form of 'distinguishing
marks', but for the **laws** that govern the *relating* of these
determinatenesses to one another -- that is, the laws of their *movement*. A
classification of all things, a catalogue of every object, is not possible, but
a set of concepts -- laws -- that govern these things seems more achievable.
This development of reason is parallel to the previous development of
consciousness from perception to the understanding.

What is a law in this context? And how does it come about? Following Harris, we
can use the story of Plato and Diogenes to exemplify the observer's sense of a
law. This is how Diogenes Laërtius tells the story:

> Plato had defined Man as an animal, biped and featherless, and was applauded.
> Diogenes plucked a fowl and brought it into the lecture-room with the words,
> 'Here is Plato's man.' In consequence of which there was added to the
> definition, 'having broad nails.'[^19]

In this story, Plato looks for a 'law' or concept to govern the universal, 'Man'
(that is, the human). He bases this law on what Hegel calls 'those
distinguishing marks, which for each of them essentially consists in not
existing for itself but in passing over into its opposite.'[^20] When Diogenes
shows that Plato's concept is too lose to define humans alone, the concept is
adapted on the basis of further distinguishing marks. Diogenes's action, more
than simply mocking Plato, says something in general about our current
conception of law. The observer is still an avowed empiricist, establishing its
laws and concepts on the basis of experience; as Hegel says, 'the *truth of the
law* is in *experience* in the way that *sensuous being* is'.[^21] The problem
in this stragey is that there might always be a Diogenes who enters the scene
and, in his dirty hands, shows us an exception to our law. No matter how much we
refine our concepts and laws, they will never have *necessity* if they are based
on the contingencies found in observation. A law that is based in such a way,
Hegel admits, is 'not really a law.'
