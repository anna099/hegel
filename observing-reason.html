<h2 id="reason">Reason</h2>
<h3 id="observing-reason">Observing Reason</h3>
<p>This first of three major sections of the <em>Phenomenology</em>’s epic account of Reason is the rational consciousness’s first attempt to ‘raise its certainty into truth, and to fulfill the empty mine.’<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The abstractions of the Kantian and Fichtean systems are to be overcome: now, reason wants to really reach into the world and understand it for itself. The world is no longer a simple object to be hopelessly grasped, as it was for consciousness (in sensuous certainty, perception, and so on). Instead, in Jean Hyppolite’s words, this braver stage of reason ‘is interested not in the sensuous as such but in the concept that resides in the sensuous.’<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> By <em>thinking</em> through nature and the sensuous world, understanding it as <em>inherently conceptual</em>, reason will find itself in the world. Whereas, in the stages of consciousness, the subject was content to merely stand before the world, naïvely ‘taking it in’, it has now developed the capacity to <em>reach out</em> to the world, <em>will</em> itself towards knowing it, and so on. This is what permits the earlier summary of Reason as the stage at which the subject’s activity is defined by <em>mediation</em>. The opening paragraph of <em>Observing Reason</em> is remarkably clear, and contains multiple clues for how this mediating relationship with the world will play out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Formerly, it just happened to consciousness that it perceived and <em>experienced</em> quite a bit in the thing; however, here it itself makes the observations and engages the experience. … Reason thus now has a universal <em>interest</em> in the world because it is the certainty of having its present moment in the world, or is certain that the present is rational. It seeks its other, while knowing that it possesses nothing else in that other but itself; it seeks only its own infinity.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, the <em>Phenomenology</em> is ultimately populated by a sequence of <em>failures</em>; consequently, in the very next paragraph, Hegel explains how observing reason will eventually fall. Its goal, as we have established, is to <em>engage</em> the world, mediate between subject and nature, and thereby feel at home in the world, and <em>among</em> the world: that is, to not be an individual abstraction, as the I of Kant and Fichte was. However,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if reason rummages around through all the innards of things, and opens all their veins so that reason might encounter itself gushing out from them, then it will have no luck; rather, it must at an earlier point have perfected itself inwardly in order to be able to experience its perfection.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the observer (this is the name I will give to our current character) will eventually come to find that it cannot find itself in the world of things while it still has an underdeveloped notion of its own selfhood. Or, as Kalkavage puts it, ‘thinghood as observation conceives it (thinghood as nature) is an inappropriate vessel for the self, whose true nature observing reason does not know.’<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> When this ‘vessel’ proves to be insufficient, reason will turn to the <em>practical</em> realm of ‘self-actualisation’ in order to know itself. Hegel makes this point himself, when he introduces the three divisions of <em>Observing Reason</em>, and gives a clue to what follows them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What observing reason is doing is to be examined in the moments of its movement as it incorporates nature, spirit, and, finally, the relation of both as sensuous being, and when as an existing actuality, it seeks itself.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>At the outset, the observer thinks in the tradition of Francis Bacon, working as an ‘unthinking consciousness.’ Hegel does not mean this in a straightforwardly disparaging way; rather, he means that the observer is engaged in a naïve kind of empiricism, which deludes itself into thinking that it relies on observation – ‘tasting, smelling, feeling, hearing, and seeing’ – alone.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The naïvety of this position is that it has forgotten the role that consciousness plays in determining the objects of experience. As Kant wrote in his <em>Prolegomena</em>, a ‘given intuition must be subsumed under a concept which determines the form of judging in general’ in order to count as <em>experience</em> and actually contribute to our knowledge of the world.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The observer cannot simply sit and gaze at the world if it wishes to actually observe it. An empiricist like Bacon thus undermines the role that thought (or, for Kant, the understanding specifically) plays in their observation of the world. This consciousness is ‘unthinking’ in the sense that it represses its own thought. (Think also of Hume’s denial of the substantial self, on the basis of it not showing up as an impression). To illustrate this point simply, we know, since the passage from sensuous certainty to perception, that any attempt at grasping a sensuous <em>this</em> always gives way to an unintended universal. Hegel makes the same point again here: ‘the meaning of what is perceived should at least be that of a <em>universal</em>, not a <em>sensuous this</em>.’</p>
<p>At first, this universal is just what consciousness finds to be stable in the movement of the observed world. As a cloud floats through the sky, slowly undulating into different shapes, I nonetheless recognise that it is the same cloud, ‘the uniform repetition of the same <em>doing</em>.’ At this stage, I have this recognition because I – the observer – have a <strong>memory</strong> of the cloud’s movement and transformation, and through my memories of it, I can identify what remains. This memory is what serves as the universal. As such, Hegel explains, the observer ‘must shift the responsibility to <em>itself</em> for the real movement of the universal.’<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> That is, universality on this account belongs only to the observer’s <em>description</em> of the world, ‘without the sensuous having in itself become a universal.’ The problem with this is captured by Hegel’s phrase, ‘the indeterminateness of the universal’: when it is up to me and my memory to identify universals in things, there is no criterion <em>in the things</em> for how these universals are identified. Amid the wealth of the observable universe, how are the lines between discrete ‘things’ to be drawn? The observer is left with an ‘endless <em>particularization</em> of the chaotic range of animals and plants, mountain ranges, metals, earth, etc.’<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Within this ‘inexhaustible supply for observing and describing’, the observer can hypothetically go on classifying forever. By use of its memory, it can take anything to be a universal; as such, ‘it can no longer know whether what seems to have being in itself is not a contingency.’<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In this overwhelming and endless game of classification, the observer comes across a sign that it has not ‘advance[d] into <em>sensuous perceiving</em>’: namely, the distinction between ‘what enables things to be <em>known</em>’ – that is, the aspects of observed objects that end up in the memory, ready to be classed as universals – and ‘the left-over range of sensuous properties, something which the thing itself cannot do without but from which consciousness exempts itself.’<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Basically, the observer has encountered another form of the thing-in-itself: this time, in Kalkavage’s words, consciousness ‘is aware that its ideas may be no more than mental constructs.’<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> It is able to recognise the difference between the essential and inessential aspects of a thing, but with this recognition comes also a ‘wavering back and forth about whether what is essential and necessary for <em>cognition</em> can also be said to be in <em>the things</em>.’<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
