<h2 id="reason">Reason</h2>
<h3 id="observing-reason">Observing Reason</h3>
<p>This first of three major sections of the <em>Phenomenology</em>’s epic account of Reason is the rational consciousness’s first attempt to ‘raise its certainty into truth, and to fulfill the empty mine.’<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The abstractions of the Kantian and Fichtean systems are to be overcome: now, reason wants to really reach into the world and understand it for itself. The world is no longer a simple object to be hopelessly grasped, as it was for consciousness (in sensuous certainty, perception, and so on). Instead, in Jean Hyppolite’s words, this braver stage of reason ‘is interested not in the sensuous as such but in the concept that resides in the sensuous.’<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> By <em>thinking</em> through nature and the sensuous world, understanding it as <em>inherently conceptual</em>, reason will find itself in the world. Whereas, in the stages of consciousness, the subject was content to merely stand before the world, naïvely ‘taking it in’, it has now developed the capacity to <em>reach out</em> to the world, <em>will</em> itself towards knowing it, and so on. This is what permits the earlier summary of Reason as the stage at which the subject’s activity is defined by <em>mediation</em>. The opening paragraph of <em>Observing Reason</em> is remarkably clear, and contains multiple clues for how this mediating relationship with the world will play out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Formerly, it just happened to consciousness that it perceived and <em>experienced</em> quite a bit in the thing; however, here it itself makes the observations and engages the experience. … Reason thus now has a universal <em>interest</em> in the world because it is the certainty of having its present moment in the world, or is certain that the present is rational. It seeks its other, while knowing that it possesses nothing else in that other but itself; it seeks only its own infinity.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, the <em>Phenomenology</em> is ultimately populated by a sequence of <em>failures</em>; consequently, in the very next paragraph, Hegel explains how observing reason will eventually fall. Its goal, as we have established, is to <em>engage</em> the world, mediate between subject and nature, and thereby feel at home in the world, and <em>among</em> the world: that is, to not be an individual abstraction, as the I of Kant and Fichte was. However,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if reason rummages around through all the innards of things, and opens all their veins so that reason might encounter itself gushing out from them, then it will have no luck; rather, it must at an earlier point have perfected itself inwardly in order to be able to experience its perfection.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the observer (this is the name I will give to our current character) will eventually come to find that it cannot find itself in the world of things while it still has an underdeveloped notion of its own selfhood. Or, as Kalkavage puts it, ‘thinghood as observation conceives it (thinghood as nature) is an inappropriate vessel for the self, whose true nature observing reason does not know.’<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> When this ‘vessel’ proves to be insufficient, reason will turn to the <em>practical</em> realm of ‘self-actualisation’ in order to know itself. Hegel makes this point himself, when he introduces the three divisions of <em>Observing Reason</em>, and gives a clue to what follows them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What observing reason is doing is to be examined in the moments of its movement as it incorporates nature, spirit, and, finally, the relation of both as sensuous being, and when as an existing actuality, it seeks itself.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>At the outset, the observer thinks in the tradition of Francis Bacon, working as an ‘unthinking consciousness.’ Hegel does not mean this in a straightforwardly disparaging way; rather, he means that the observer is engaged in a naïve kind of empiricism, which deludes itself into thinking that it relies on observation – ‘tasting, smelling, feeling, hearing, and seeing’ – alone.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The naïvety of this position is that it has forgotten the role that consciousness plays in determining the objects of experience. As Kant wrote in his <em>Prolegomena</em>, a ‘given intuition must be subsumed under a concept which determines the form of judging in general’ in order to count as <em>experience</em> and actually contribute to our knowledge of the world.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The observer cannot simply sit and gaze at the world if it wishes to actually observe it. An empiricist like Bacon thus undermines the role that thought (or, for Kant, the understanding specifically) plays in their observation of the world. This consciousness is ‘unthinking’ in the sense that it represses its own thought. (Think also of Hume’s denial of the substantial self, on the basis of it not showing up as an impression). To illustrate this point simply, we know, since the passage from sensuous certainty to perception, that any attempt at grasping a sensuous <em>this</em> always gives way to an unintended universal. Hegel makes the same point again here: ‘the meaning of what is perceived should at least be that of a <em>universal</em>, not a <em>sensuous this</em>.’</p>
<p>At first, this universal is just what consciousness finds to be stable in the movement of the observed world. As a cloud floats through the sky, slowly undulating into different shapes, I nonetheless recognise that it is the same cloud, ‘the uniform repetition of the same <em>doing</em>.’ At this stage, I have this recognition because I – the observer – have a <strong>memory</strong> of the cloud’s movement and transformation, and through my memories of it, I can identify what remains. This memory is what serves as the universal. As such, Hegel explains, the observer ‘must shift the responsibility to <em>itself</em> for the real movement of the universal.’<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> That is, universality on this account belongs only to the observer’s <em>description</em> of the world, ‘without the sensuous having in itself become a universal.’ The problem with this is captured by Hegel’s phrase, ‘the indeterminateness of the universal’: when it is up to me and my memory to identify universals in things, there is no criterion <em>in the things</em> for how these universals are identified. Amid the wealth of the observable universe, how are the lines between discrete ‘things’ to be drawn? The observer is left with an ‘endless <em>particularization</em> of the chaotic range of animals and plants, mountain ranges, metals, earth, etc.’<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Within this ‘inexhaustible supply for observing and describing’, the observer can hypothetically go on classifying forever. By use of its memory, it can take anything to be a universal; as such, ‘it can no longer know whether what seems to have being in itself is not a contingency.’<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In this overwhelming and endless game of classification, the observer comes across a sign that it has not ‘advance[d] into <em>sensuous perceiving</em>’. Specifically, the observing consciousness ends up with a distinction between ‘what enables things to be <em>known</em>’ – that is, the aspects of observed objects that end up in the memory, ready to be classed as universals – and ‘the left-over range of sensuous properties, something which the thing itself cannot do without but from which consciousness exempts itself.’<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> This distinction essentially gives us another form of the thing-in-itself: this time, in Kalkavage’s words, consciousness ‘is aware that its ideas may be no more than mental constructs.’<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> It is able to recognise the difference between the essential and inessential aspects of a thing, but with this recognition comes also a ‘wavering back and forth about whether what is essential and necessary for <em>cognition</em> can also be said to be in <em>the things</em>.’<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> This is a major problem for a rational observer, who is so preoccupied with finding reason not just within themselves but also within the world.</p>
<p>Consequently, observing reason quickly looks for a solution to this ‘wavering’. In this search, it realises that anything that is cognised as ‘essential’ can only be cognised as such if it counts as ‘that through which [things] <em>break free</em> from the universal continuity of being as such, <em>cut</em> themselves <em>loose</em> from others, and be <em>for themselves</em>.’<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> That is, if a thing is recognised by consciousness as a distinct ‘thing’ at all, it must be thanks to certain elements of that thing which, regardless of any observation, make the thing distinct among the rest of the world (or, what Hegel elegantly calls ‘the universal continuity of being’). In still other words, that which separates an object to the observer must have already separated the object <em>from other objects</em>. In illustrating this point, Hegel turns to the example of taxonomy, where he clearly has Linnaeus in mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The distinguishing marks of animals, for example, are taken from their claws and teeth. Indeed, not only does cognition <em>distinguish</em> one animal from another by this means, but it is by these means that the animal itself <em>separates</em> itself off from others. It is through these weapons that it preserves itself <em>for itself</em> and keeps itself detached from the universal.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, Hegel realises that not all objects are animals; that is, not all objects ‘get as far’ as <em>being-for-themselves</em>. Plants have no ‘intention’ or will to survive; the only ‘distinguishing marks’ that Hegel finds in them arise from their ‘<em>dividing themselves in two</em>’ in sexual differentiation.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> This limit in distinction, he explains, is what makes plants harder <em>for us</em> to distinguish from one another, in comparison to animals. However, ‘at an even lower level’ – i.e., the level of chemical objects – things make no ‘effort’ to distinguish themselves at all; often, they dissolve into one another and change form constantly. Such an object ‘cannot itself any longer differentiate itself from an other’. It is seemingly a different thing when it is ‘<em>motionless</em>’ to when it is ‘<em>in relationships</em>’; in this difference, we see the world of constant flux that Heraclitus described. Accordingly, the wavering question – of whether our cognition is really grasping what the observed objects <em>actually are</em> – arises again. There is movement in the world that the observer’s account of universals cannot account for. A memory does not move.</p>
<h4 id="laws">Observation of Nature: II. Laws of Nature</h4>
<p>The only way to overcome this problem is to form a new account of the universal – one which won’t hope for ‘<em>inert</em> determinateness’, but instead will expect precisely what it sees in the observed world: that is, the <em>shifting</em> of determinacy. The truth of determinateness, Hegel explains, is ‘<em>its relating itself to its opposite</em>.’<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The ‘instinct of reason’ pushes the observer now to look not merely for ‘determinatenesses’ in the form of ‘distinguishing marks’, but for the <strong>laws</strong> that govern the <em>relating</em> of these determinatenesses to one another – that is, the laws of their <em>movement</em>. A classification of all things, a catalogue of every object, is not possible, but a set of concepts – laws – that govern these things seems more achievable. This development of reason is parallel to the previous development of consciousness from perception to the understanding.</p>
<p>What is a law in this context? And how does it come about? Following Harris, we can use the story of Plato and Diogenes to exemplify the observer’s sense of a law. This is how Diogenes Laërtius tells the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plato had defined Man as an animal, biped and featherless, and was applauded. Diogenes plucked a fowl and brought it into the lecture-room with the words, ‘Here is Plato’s man.’ In consequence of which there was added to the definition, ‘having broad nails.’<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this story, Plato looks for a ‘law’ or concept to govern the universal, ‘Man’ (that is, the human). He bases this law on what Hegel calls ‘those distinguishing marks, which for each of them essentially consists in not existing for itself but in passing over into its opposite.’<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> When Diogenes shows that Plato’s concept is too lose to define humans alone, the concept is adapted on the basis of further distinguishing marks. Diogenes’s action, more than simply mocking Plato, says something in general about our current conception of law. The observer is still an avowed empiricist, establishing its laws and concepts on the basis of experience; as Hegel says, ‘the <em>truth of the law</em> is in <em>experience</em> in the way that <em>sensuous being</em> is’.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The problem in this strategy is that there might always be a Diogenes who enters the scene and, in his dirty hands, shows us an exception to our law. No matter how much we refine our concepts and laws, they will never have <em>necessity</em> if they are based on the contingencies found in observation. A law that is based in such a way, Hegel admits, is ‘not really a law.’</p>
<p>The problem the observer now faces is this: without room for necessity, a law cannot be a law; however, without room for <em>contingency</em>, a law has nothing to govern. The current sense of law, based simply on observation of contingencies, clearly has no room for necessity. But this problem doesn’t have to last, Hegel explains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, the law’s being a concept not only does not conflict with its being available for observation, but is rather the very reason it is in possession of necessary <em>existence</em> [<em>Dasein</em>], and is for observation. The universal in the sense of a <em>rational universality</em> is also the universal in the previous sense of its exhibiting itself <em>for that</em> consciousness as what is current and actual … but without thereby losing its nature and falling back down into inert stable existence or indifferent succession.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these sentences, Hegel is basically claiming that it is possible for necessity (that is, <em>universality</em>) to be found <em>within</em> the contingency of the observer’s experience. When he claims that ‘the concept presents itself in the mode of thinghood’, he is explaining that the contingent things of our experience are, in fact, the <em>manifestation</em> of the conceptual, lawlike, and <em>rational</em> side of reality. When ‘concept’ is understood as what he calls ‘<em>rational</em> universality’, it is understood not as the artificial <em>abstraction</em> from observed things, but as the genuine <em>reality</em> of what those things <em>are</em>. <em>Law</em>, then, is the recognition of the inherent link between rational universality and the world we observe: if the latter did not have rational universality as its very reality, it would not be possible to make sense of it at all. As such, Hegel makes a profound and aphoristic statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What <em>ought</em> to be is also in fact what <em>is</em>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement might sound illegitimate, but only if it isn’t properly thought through. It is, in one sense, a critique of the Kantian tradition’s postulation that there is a ‘noumenal’ world that, despite having no presence in possible experience, ‘is the standard of “pure Reason” by which the phenomenal world of “experience” is to be judged’, as Harris puts it.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> As far as <em>actual experience</em> goes, the noumenon is a concept which ‘only <em>should</em> be, but is not’; and a concept of this sort, Hegel says, ‘has no real truth’.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Our laws and concepts of the world are of no use whatsoever if we don’t find their truth within reality. Accordingly, the observer is now at the stage of asserting that ‘the truth of the law is essentially <em>reality</em>.’<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Laws are no longer established by generalising and abstracting from singular observations, but instead through <em>experimentation</em> and inductive reasoning about the observed world. Francis Bacon himself wrote that ‘we regard induction as the form of demonstration which respects the senses, stays close to nature, fosters results and is almost involved in them itself’; it is likely that, at this point, Hegel has projects such as Bacon’s in mind.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>As he goes on, Hegel admits that, so long as consciousness ‘sticks to observation’, there is a tension between its new conception of law as ‘essentially <em>reality</em>’ and ‘the universal in itself’. Indeed, he says, such a thing as [the observer’s] law is not an essence that stems from reason.’<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> For an observer that wants to find reason in itself and in the world, this is a major problem. It arises because, through what we can call the observer’s ‘inductive method’, consciousness is forced to concede that not ‘<em>all singular</em> sensuous things must have provided evidence for the appearance of law in order for it to be able to assert the truth of the law.’<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> This is an intuitive point about inductive reason, wherein Hegel is echoing Hume. ‘Laws’ of the inductive method are arrived at through experimentation; but it is impossible to arrive at a truly universal law by experimenting on <em>all</em> objects. Newton didn’t theorise about gravity by watching <em>every</em> apple fall. Instead, inductive reason arrives only at <em>probability</em>, which is not truth. As Hegel says stubbornly, ‘let the probability be as great as it may, vis-à-vis truth, it is nothing.’</p>
