<!-- Introduction -->
[^1]: All quotations in this paragraph are taken from Hegel, *Early Theological Writings*, pp. 248-251. See also Frederick Beiser, *Hegel*, p. 115.
[^2]: The German word Hegel uses for alienation -- Entäußerung -- was used in Luther's translation of the Bible to refer to God's 'emptying' himself in becoming flesh. Pinkard (in his translator's note to *The Phenomenology of Spirit*, p. xlii) claims that Hegel would have intended this connotation.
[^3]: §483. We could say, therefore, that to be alienated or atomised by one's society is to be *objectified* by it.

[^89]: My claim here is inspired by how, in the first chapter of the *Phenomenology*, Hegel describes consciousness as beginning with the aim of 'pure apprehension' (§116) and as distinct from conceptual comprehension (§90). Comprehension, he argues, involves a 'reflective turn' (§118).
