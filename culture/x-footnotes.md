[^2]: The German word Hegel uses for alienation -- Entäußerung -- was used in Luther's translation of the Bible to refer to God's 'emptying' himself in becoming flesh. Pinkard (in his translator's note to *The Phenomenology of Spirit*, p. xlii) claims that Hegel would have intended this connotation.

[^28]: Miller translates this word as 'ignoble', but Pinkard, Baillie, and Inwood opt for 'base'. Harris (*Hegel's Ladder*, II, p. 310n33) argues that both are mistranslations which oversimplify the connotations of *niederträchtig*.
