## Spirit

### Alienated Spirit: Culture

In a beautiful passage of his early work *The Spirit of Christianity and its
Fate*, Hegel gives an analysis of the Last Supper.[^1] He writes of the 'bond of
friendship' and the acts that actualise friendship and love, and he takes the
sharing of Jesus's cup to be a paradigmatic case of such acts. But the passage
is most interesting because it is one of Hegel's earliest examinations of
*spirit*. 'Objectively considered, then, the bread is just bread, the wine just
wine; yet both are something more': in the Last Supper, as Hegel understands it,
we see things take on a significance beyond their natural existence -- that is,
we see *spirit* arise from out of nature. We do not have to be religious to
understand his point, since we can interpret it as an allegory: in the bread and
wine that Jesus offers, Hegel writes, the *spirit* of Jesus 'has become a
present object, a reality, for external feeling'. Then, in the consumption of
the bread and wine, the spirit that has become objective 'reverts once more to
its nature, becomes subjective again in the eating'. Hegel gives another
analogy, this time non-religious: 'This return may perhaps in this respect be
compared with the thought which in the written word becomes a thing and which
recaptures its subjectivity out of an object, out of something lifeless, when we
read.' Both the Last Supper and the act of reading have the same structure:
something internal (Jesus's spiritual presence, or the thought of a writer) is
*externalised*, and then (through the eating or reading carried out by the
Other) is *re-internalised* and takes on a new significance.

This motif -- of going outside of oneself and then returning -- is precisely how
spirit comes on the scene. Now, in the *Phenomenology*'s sixth chapter, we are
concerned with spirit in a more sophisticated sense: spirit is not here
restricted to a small group of disciples or to a writer and reader, but is
something permeating societies in general. The harmonious society of Greece was
the site of spirit in its first, immediate existence. Now, before we reach the
existence of spirit as self-conscious in and for itself, we must work through
its second moment, its externalisation out of itself: that is, its
*alienation*.[^2]

What then does it mean to be alienated? The answer is that self-consciousness
and its ethical substance -- that is, the individual and society -- are in a
conscious 'unity' but nonetheless experience 'alienation' from each other. In
other word, the individual recognises themselves as part of a society, as a
constituent of their social environment, but nonetheless does not feel at home
in this society. This stage of culture, therefore, runs parallel to unhappy
consciousness, wherein self-consciousness felt alienated from a 'God' who,
unbeknownst to them, was within them from the start. By alienating the
individuals that constitute it, the 'substance' of the social world 'is itself
its own self-relinquishing': it splits itself into two, externalising what is
internal to it.[^3] This is precisely how ethical substance, *as spirit*, moves
into its second stage: in undergoing this externalisation, alienation, or
self-relinquishing, it ascends from out of its immediate existence (which we saw
in Greece) and awaits the return into itself through which it will reach its
truth. Hyppolite notes that Hegel's inclusion of alienation within an account of
cultural education is a challenge to his contemporaries.[^3.1] For classical
Enlightenment thinkers, the individual undergoes education in straightforward
upward progress, and for 'humanist pedagogy' nature undergoes a harmonious
development within the human being. For Hegel, however, to undergo formation and
education involves a movement of self-inequaility and distance from oneself.

Because they are alienated, whenever the individual of culture enters 'the
actual world', they always 'pass over again back into actual
self-consciousness'.[^4] In other words, their experience of the social world is
so unwelcoming and unfamiliar that they plunge back into thought, constructing
their own world -- the opposite of the present moment, or the '*other-worldly
beyond*'.[^5] This is yet another similarity with unhappy consciousness. Because
of these similarities, and because of what preceded this chapter, we might be
inclined to think that here Hegel is thinking of Christianity as it came to
flourish following the conversion of Constantine. However, we also know that
Hegel took the alienation described in this chapter as a defining characteristic
of *modernity*, and his explicit references (to the Enlightenment, the French
Revolution and the Terror) suggest that he is thinking of the modern era. Robert
Solomon argues that the *Phenomenology* simply jumps from Rome to modernity -- a
'glaring omission' that proves to us that Hegel is not attempting a literal
history.[^6] On the other hand, Terry Pinkard argues that Hegel, unlike his
contemporaries, did not think of the ancient era as separated from modernity by
the so-called 'Middle Ages'.[^7] On this view, for Hegel as for Nietzsche, the
first signs of modernity are present in the birth of the Christian conception of
selfhood, and when I refer to 'modernity' in the Hegelian context, this should
be understood as *including* the medieval era. So, while Solomon is partially
right -- the *Phenomenology* is not a literal history, as I have explained above
-- he is wrong to find an 'omission' in the book. The present chapter takes us
on a route from medieval Christianity through the Enlightenment and up to the
climax of the French Revolution, in a manner that, admittedly, may be more
logical than chronological.

To close the introductory section of this chapter, Hegel gives a summary of the
entire section in one long paragraph. Spirit has become divided, opposed within
itself, and gives way to 'a doubled world'.[^8] Although the world is present
before us, its *essence* is understood as belonging to some 'beyond' --
everything thus 'receives actuality from an other'. Individuals in
self-alienated spirit take the *truth* of the world to be separated from the
world they inhabit, postponed to a realm beyond life. The premodern world was
divided (for instance, into human and divine law), but its inhabitants didn't
acknowledge this divide because they immediately identified with it, on the
basis of 'nature'. In alienated modernity, people actually *acknowledge* these
dualisms and attempt to conceptually comprehend them in various ways. Living
according to these dichotomies they have posited, modern individuals adopt
**cultural formation** (*Bildung*) as their form of life and attempt to
transform their selfhood (as the characters in *Bildungsromane* do) in order to
align themselves with the 'good' side of a dichotomy -- or, as Taylor puts it,
'to close the gap between themselves and social reality.'[^9] Of course, all
such attempts prevent a real unity with the world and keep the individuals from
being at home in their world.

There are two systems of dichotomies that self-consciousness posits following
its entry into the stage of cultural formation: firstly, a worldview wherein the
world is taken as untrue in contrast to a harmonious beyond, posited by
**faith**, 'which has no actual present'.[^10] Secondly, when this faith is
interpreted in the secular terms of the **Enlightenment**, the 'housekeeping of
faith' is brought into 'disarray' as the present world is comprehended coldly in
terms of *utility*, and the beyond is taken to be utterly unknowable '*absolute
essence*'. Though the Enlightenment robs the world of any substantiality,
promoting only the equally empty worldviews of deism or materialism, the
priority it affords to the actual individual paves the way for the **absolute
freedom** exhibited in the French Revolution, through which spirit 'abandons
this land of cultural formation and crosses over into another land, into the
land of *moral consciousness*.'
