#### Cultural Formation and its Realm of Actuality

The world of culture, as Hegel sees it, is one wherein are equal. This equality
is not established through legal status or legal status or through mutual
recognition, but through each individual's equal alienated conformity to the
universal. Everyone relinquishes their individuality -- gives up their desires,
personalities, and so on -- in order to bring the world to its actuality and
achieve oneness with the beyond. Seeing the world as something alien, cultural
individuals aim not to belong in the world but to 'take possession' of it,
precisely by mastering nature (especially their own natural existence) according
to God's will.[^12] *Bildung* is the name for this mastery.

By carrying out their life in this way, the individual comes to realise that
their 'actuality still solely consists in their sublation of [their] natural
self.'[^13] We should therefore understand 'culture' as that element of life
which Rousseau was so upset about, through which 'everything degenerates in the
hands of man.'[^14] Unlike Rousseau, the individual at this stage of the
*Phenomenology* venerates culture and is dismissive of nature: they regard
individuality as 'falsely posited as lying in the *particularity* of nature';
individuality is rather found in alienated *Bildung*, in the grand world of
culture that looks with contempt upon the lowly world of our natural existence.
The cultured individual urges us to forget the 'powerless' and 'non-actual'
contingencies of nature; insofar as we are engaged in cultural formation, they
claim, we are all equal before God. (This is the equality of 'conformity' that I
introduced above.)

Without being aware of it, the individual still has a relation to the social
world that it feels alienated from. In the process of cultural formation, 'the
individual empties itself of its own self' -- that is, renunciates its
pre-cultural characteristics -- and *gives itself over* to culture (or, more
precisely, to the institutions, communities, and practices that embody
culture).[^15] 'Hence,' Hegel writes, 'its cultural formation and its own
actuality are the actualization of substance itself.' Although the individual
takes 'culture' to be an alien essence, instituted by God's will, it is in fact
*constituted* by the individual's *Bildung*.

What shape does this constitution take? The individual, which still lives along
the dualistic lines of unhappy consciousness, divides social substance up into
opposing parts which exist through their opposition to one another. The
'thinking' of cultured individuals, Hegel explains, establishes the *difference*
between these two parts by identifying one as 'good' and the other as
'bad'.[^15] The individual thus acts like the 'soul' of their society,
attempting to understand its structure and development by fixing it into rigid
categories. In this sense, the individual actually understands themselves *not*
as an individual first and foremost, but instead as a living expression or
articulation of the culture they live in -- since, for now, they do not realise
that they themselves constitute this culture. We will see the downfall of this
form of individuality when each 'moment' it posits of society -- 'good', 'bad',
or whatever else -- passes into its opposite and the entire categorisation is
undermined.

The first form of categorisation Hegel presents us with breaks society up into
various estates.

> Just as nature explicates itself into universal elements, under which fall
> [air, water, fire, and earth] ... In this way, the inner *essence*, or the
> simple spirit of self-consciousness actuality, explicates itself into just
> those kinds of universal, though spiritual, social estates.[^16]

This is a strange claim. The parallel drawn between a natural division (the four
elements) and a social division (the estates) might remind us of the Greek
system of human and divine law being based on 'natural' gender distinctions, and
this resonance is prboably intentional. The difference here, however, is that in
this passage Hegel is presumably only giving an *analogy*, rather than a causal
explanation. Nonetheless, the characteristics that he attributes to each of the
four elements are comparable with the characteristics of the social estates he
describes.

1. *Air*: the element which *endures* and in which 'everything individual is
   sublimated' -- corresponding to the social essence as it is purely in itself
   and equal to itself, and the '**state power**' which renders individuals as
   uniform.[^17]
2. *Water*: the element which stands for 'the real possibility of difference',
   which in its form is 'ever sacrificed' rather than enduring -- corrseponding
   to the social essence as it is *for* itself, unequal to itself and
   self-sacrificing, manifest in '**wealth**', the social form of free
   consumption and self-interest.
3. *Fire*: the element of 'individuality existing on its own account', 'a
   self-relating negativity' -- corresponding to the social essence existing in
   *and* for itself, giving way to the rise of real subjectivity and
   self-consciousness. The 'force of fire' in a society is thus its latent
   potential for a revolution which will come about only when its estates
   ('state power' and 'wealth') are recognised as dissolving into one another.
4. *Earth*: the element distinct from all the others which is 'indeterminate'
   but nonetheless is 'the totality which holds together' the other elements --
   corresponding to social essence *as such*, the ground 'from which [social
   phenomena] start and to which they return.'
