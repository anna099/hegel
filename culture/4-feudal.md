We begin when the noble consciousness acts on its judgment. In their satisfied
agreement with society, the noble individual devotes themselves to 'the heroism
of *service*': they devote their lives to state power, to the public good.[^35]
In doing so, they establish the second estate of the Ancien Régime -- the
**nobility** -- and bestow actual *existence* onto state power. Through the
renunciation of their self-interest, the noble earns respect; through the
devotion of their existence to state power, they transform state power from an
abstract goal into an actualised institution (the law, the rule of the land,
etc.). However, this institution is not yet truly *embodied*; it has no
'particular will' but is only as 'essential' will, a custom without a
self-directed executive (like a King) to interpret this custom. Hegel refers to
the nobles as 'vassals', who value themselves only insofar as they have the
'honour' of contributing to the upkeep of state power. Nonetheless, for as long
as state power is not embodied in a self-conscious, particular actuality, the
'counsel' offered by the vassal is of little use; the 'general good' is all that
has power.[^36]

In this undeveloped shape, Hegel explains, state power 'is indecisive about the
different opinions about the common good.' It is not yet *government*. There may
be a monarch, to be sure, but the monarch has no being-for-itself on which to
discriminate between the contradictory directions it might receive in the form
of counsel. The counselling vassals themselves, meanwhile, renounce themselves
(that is, sacrifice themselves to state power) only in a qualified sense. If
their counsel opposes the 'general good' -- however indistinct the latter might
be -- their life will be on the line. Having to censor themselves in the face of
the danger of death, 'the counselor in fact reserves for himself his own opinion
and his particular individual will in the face of state-authority.'[^37]
Consequently, it turns out that the noble consciousness is not quite as
deferential as it once thought; the vassal 'is always within a stone's throw of
rebellion', harbouring a latent contempt for the inequality between their
being-for-itself and the universality of state power. Base consciousness is the
truth of noble consciousness.

If it is to retain its being-for-itself, and avoid either dying or becoming a
lifeless servant to state power, the counselor must somehow sacrifice themselves
completely, 'as it does in death', but without dying.[^38] The only way it can
do this is by *relinquishing its being-for-itself*, and it can only do that
insofar as state power is also a self. How can this be done? How am I able to
completely give myself over to something (or, indeed, some*one*) without dying?
In Hyppolite's words, the task is 'to find an exteriority of the I such that
that exteriority still remains I.'[^39] Hegel finds such an exteriority in
**language**.

We have already encountered the theme of language in the *Phenomenology*. In the
first chapter of the book, it is in language that 'we immediately refute what we
mean to say'; in the fifth chapter, the subject who speaks 'abandons [their
inwardness] to their other.'[^40] Language is thus understood in terms of loss;
through language our interiority is abandoned, we lose hold of our intention. In
other words, to speak is to surrender without dying: this is why the noble
counsellor must turn to language

At this point, Hegel develops his philosophy of language in reflections which
take the *form* of language for their *content*. The counsellor speaks of
themselves – they say 'I'. Only in language does the 'I' properly come into
existence; it distinguishes itself from 'you' and expresses my existence *for
others*. Before the act of language, Hegel claims, the self merely 'reflects
itself into itself', taking on only 'an incomplete existence, a soulless
existence'.[^41] This distinguishing is not something stable, however. In being
spoken – in being '*brought to a hearing*' – the 'I' loses any sense of private
particularity, in the same manner as the 'now' and 'here' of sensuous certainty
did, and thus enters the sphere of the *universal*.[^42] The sound of speech and
the sight of writing (i.e., the *particularities* of language) might be
fleeting, but the meaning, the *universality* of language, persists just so long
as it is heard or read.

Language thus starts to actualise the 'I that is we', to materialise the spirit
that is implicit within culture. (Hegel seems to have recognised a close link
between language and spirit even before writing the *Phenomenology*; in an 1805
letter to Johann Heinrich Voss, who translated the *Odyssey* into German, Hegel
wrote that just as Luther had done for the Bible, his endeavour was 'to teach
philosophy to speak German.'[^43]) Between the two extremes of culture – the
individual and social substance (here, the noble consciousness and state power)
– language serves as the mediating middle through which '*spiritual substance*
enters into existence.[^44]

However, this spirit is still only subjective and is thus undeveloped. Of the
two extremes that are united in language, one of them (consciousness, the
counsellor) follows state power out of *honour* but not true *obligation*, and
this is because the other extreme (state power, the monarch) currently takes
form only as the 'common good' and not as an actual '*will*'.[^45] The exercises
of language will attempt to overcome this imperfection. We will see the crucial
function of language, by which the individual alienates themselves and becomes
universal and by which state power gains selfhood, take two different shapes in
its development: one of absolutist flattery, the other of dogmatist
'laceration'.[^46]

To start with, noble consciousness gives rise to a state-power-with-selfhood
(or, a *willing* monarch) through **flattery**, the speaking successor to the
silent 'heroism of service'. Flattery endows the monarch with their name and all
its authoritative connotation; it elevates the monarch to a 'pure individual
singular, no longer only in his own consciousness but in the consciousness of
all.'[^47] It is generally accepted that here Hegel is thinking of Louis XIV,
the absolute monarch. Around the king, the rest of the nobility sit and serve as
his 'ornaments', Hegel writes, and the purpose is to reproduce his authority
through flattery.

One way of understanding this process is that the flattering language of the
nobility serves as *recognition* of the monarch's right to rule. Recognition,
for Hegel, is the phenomenon through which the Other, who might ordinarily be an
*obstacle* to my acting, actually *opens up* my freedom to act.[^48] This is why
flattery does not just *please* the monarchy, but in fact 'gives it a
self-conscious existence' with the capacity for 'willing and deciding'.[^49]
This flattery is an illustration of the performativity of language.

The nobles also benefit from this relationship; in thanks for their flattery,
the monarch delegates power of the state back to them. The king is the 'self' of
state- power – its will and direction – and his nobles are its 'essence',
through which his will is actualised. Through this delegation, however, the
monarchy begins to undermine itself: state-power, despite having become spirit,
has become 'an essence whose spirit consists in being sacrificed and
relinquished'.[^50] Power is handed out generously as the gift of privilege and,
as such, becomes … wealth. The monarch unwittingly transforms themselves into a
mere distributor of wealth, a servant to the now-prosperous nobility. 'All that
remains to it of *universally* recognized and non-mediated self-sufficiency is
the empty name': the king might as well exist only as a portrait on a bank note.
The nobles consequently see little equality between themselves and the monarch.
And in their scrambling for wealth, their flattery has become totally
inauthentic; it is nothing more than a way for them to receive extra riches.
They become like Regan and Goneril in *King Lear*, and in them the difference
between noble and base consciousness has totally dissolved.

The social world is now one of 'clients' and 'benefactors'. A 'client' -- an
individual who devotes their life to accruing wealth -- sees their selfhood
placed 'under the authority of an alien will', Hegel explains.[^51] What he
means by this is that, now that wealth has become the central concern, the point
around which a life is oriented, it has become an end in itself. Individuals
have thus emptied out their selfhood *into* wealth, depending on it completely
(as an 'alien will'). Self-consciousness takes wealth as its object, but wealth
is itself just the objectified, *alienated* form of self-consciousness; as such,
and just as with the end of observing reason, self-consciousness has found
itself manifest as a dead thing.[^52] Upon acknowledging this contradiction --
between themselves as an independent subject for-itself and as a dead thing --
the individual 'stands above' it, 'sublates the self's sublation', and takes the
form of 'absolute elasticity'.[^53] This elastic subject accepts wealth from
their benefactors but dismisses their benefactors nonetheless, looking with
contempt and cynicism upon the social world.[^53]

As the rich benefactors and patrons of society arrogantly think that 'with a
meal' they can purchase the selfhood of their clients, they overlook the 'inner
indignation' and 'pure disruption' that this selfhood represents.[^54] There is
nothing stable about the elastic individual; they are a cynical nihilist,
willing to change their mindset in an instant, devoted only to a complete lack
of devotion at all. Hegel dramatically describes how the aristocratic
benefactor stands before this nihilism, underestimating it completely:

> It stands immediately before this most inward abyss, before this bottomless
> depth, in which all foothold and substance have vanished, and in these depths
> it sees nothing but a common thing, a play of its vagaries, an accident of its
> arbitrary choices. Its spirit is just essenceless opinion, a superficiality
> forsaken by spirit.[^55]

Perhaps in this notion of 'essenceless opinion' there is a foreshadowing of
Kierkegaard and Heidegger, two bourgeois critics of society, with their notions
of 'chatter' and 'idle talk'. Kierkegaard criticises the chatter which talks
about 'anything and everything' without any reflection or *inwardness*;[^56]
Heidegger describes (but does not *disparage*, he claims) the idle talk which
'gossips' with an air of authority but loses a 'primary relationship' to its
subject matter.[^57] However, the nihilistic critic that Hegel is describing is
a lot less serious and reverent than Kierkegaard and Hegel; this critic is the
young Rameau whose mocking language 'is the perfected language of this entire
world of culture'.[^58]

Rameau is practically undefeatable in conversation: by the time someone has
refuted a point of his, he has already moved on to something else. He
'repudiates his own abjectness', Hegel writes; his identity is 'disruption', the
total lack of consistent identity. As a form of self-consciousness, Rameau (and
any 'client' consciousness that he represents) still asserts himself and his
identity, but 'this identical judgment is at the same time the infinite
judgment': that is, his identity is defined by a negation.[^59] Keeping in mind
that infinite judgments always have the structure 'X is not Y', we should
understand Rameau's identity to be defined as something like: 'I am not
cultured'. Crucially, it is in this disavowal that Rameau *most exemplifies*
culture: the disruption of his nihilism and relativism are culture in its
absolute truth, in the chaotic and constant dissolution of all of its elements
into one another.

The 'turmoil-ridden *judging*' is the final stage in culture's development. The
individual who has undergone the greatest *Bildung*, the greatest cultural
formation, is what Hegel calls 'the disruptive consciousness', and it is they
who most truthfully represent the feudal world of culture.[^60] In their
'candor' (that is, their self-awareness in having no consistency) this cultured
individual finds 'a strain of reconciliation'; they are '*denatured*' by a 'strain
of the ridiculous' -- Hegel is quoting Diderot here -- and thereby get closer to
a truly *spiritual* existence.[^61]

Because the disruptive consciousness represents the truth of culture as a whole,
their opponent -- the *philosophe*, or what Hegel calls 'simple consciousness'
-- is left lost for words. If they can muster up anything beyond mere
'monosyllables', they will still be representing only a particular moment of
culture and will therefore be saying nothing that the disruptive nihilist does
not already know.[^62] If they cite *examples* of 'the excellent' -- stories
that are supposed to convince us that, really, culture *does* have a noble
element, and wealth and flattery aren't just hypocritical emptinesses -- the
nihilist can simply respond by pointing out that these are only individual
cases; they don't hold up to the holism of the disruptive view of society. 'To
present the existence of the good and the noble as a single anecdote, whether
fictitious or true,' Hegel writes, 'is the most caustic thing that can be said
about it.'[^63]
