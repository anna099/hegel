## Reason {#begin}

### Introduction

There is a dramatic change between the eclipse of unhappy consciousness and the
dawn of reason. The unhappy subject, who goes again and again on a pilgrimage to
the church in order to witness God through a medium, is still ultimately
unhappy: for God's salvation comes only in the heavenly kingdom, when all that
is singular and contingent is finally shrugged off. For the unhappy subject,
there is no community until we die.

Now, however, unhappy consciousness is no longer at the forefront of things. In
Hegel's enormous chapter on *Reason* (consisting of over two-hundred
paragraphs), the foundations for positivity and a real community, prior to
heaven, are established. The key to the success of reason is *mediation*, which
emerged in self-consciousness in the figure of the 'mediating counsel' or
priest. Now, we (the phenomenological observers) must recognise that what
appeared in self-consciousness as three distinct entities -- the unhappy
subject, the unchangeable God, and the mediating priest -- are finally
understood as three moments of one unified position: namely, the *syllogism* of
reason. What first appeared as the priest's mediation between God and the
unhappy worshipper is now recognised as *reason's* mediation between the
unchangeable universal and the singular individual. Reason's power to mediate is
the first appearance of philosophical thought proper, 'the unity that
immediately knows both of the other terms, relates both of them to each other,
and is the consciousness of their unity'.[^1]

Being the site of mediation between the universal and particular, reason begins
with the pompous certainty of 'being all truth'. The mediating ego or *I* is
thus at the centre of the whole world: we are now in the era of **idealism**.
For as long as the self has been conscious of itself -- from its earliest desire
to the apex of unhappy consciousness -- it has had a negative relationship towards the world. 'Formerly', Hegel says of the subject, 'it did not understand
the world; it desired it and worked on it, withdrew itself from it, took an
inward turn back into itself away from it, and erased the world for itself and
itself as consciousness'.[^2] It is only now, with reason's power of mediation,
that self and world -- thinking and being -- are united, one and the same. It is
at this point that we can declare Parmenides' saying: <span lang="el">τὸ γὰρ
αὐτὸ νοεῖν ἐστίν τε καὶ εἶναι</span> [*being and thinking are one and the
same*].[^3]

In his commentary on the *Phenomenology*, J. N. Findlay gives a clear summary of
the starting position of reason:

> Consciousness in the experience of absolution has risen to the realization
> that the individual consciousness is implicitly one with the Absolute Essence
> which is, however, still placed essentially beyond itself. In this realization
> self-consciousness has been projected into the world of objects, into the
> realm of being, and it has also identified itself with the universal. It has
> become the middle term in a syllogism which reconciles the individual with the
> unchangeable universal, and which thereby sees itself as all truth.[^4]

In what particular way does reason 'see itself as all truth'? Recall that every
shape of knowing in the *Phenomenology* so far begins with *certainty*: an
immediate and often naive claim to truth. The chapter on reason begins in just
the same way: Hegel makes a distinction between an idealism that recognises the
journey (from sensuous certainty to self-consciousness) that is necessary for
'*proving*' that the I is all truth and all reality, and the idealism for whom
this journey is forgotten. In its present moment of certainty, reason fits the
latter description. 'It only gives *the assurance* of being all reality, but
does not itself comprehend this, for the comprehension of this immediately
expressed assertion is that forgotten path itself'.[^5] This kind of naive,
asserted idealism is thus only 'an *immediate certainty* against which other
immediate certainties stand in contrast': since the naive idealist has forgotten
the dialectical overcoming of the certainties in consciousness and
self-consciousness (sensuous certainty and the desiring I, respectively), it is
unable to overcome these certainties, or prove itself against them.[^6] This point
may be specifically directed at J. G. Fichte's idealism. In the introduction to
his idealist system, Fichte claims that 'to begin with, idealism is unable to
refute dogmatism', and that 'the dogmatist is equally incapable of refuting the
idealist'.[^7] For Hegel, Fichte is forced to see idealism and dogmatism as
incapable of refuting one another because he has ignored the dialectical path
that makes idealism *possible*.

There is a sense here in which Fichte is actually less sophisticated than his
predecessor, Kant. As Dieter Henrich put it, Kant's critical project relied on
the fact that 'before there can be an insight that there is some illusion in
this metaphysics, there has first to be an original metaphysics. ... Because, in
his view, one cannot get to the truth all at once at the beginning, there are
necessary stages of the development of philosophy'.[^8] This is far closer to
Hegel's realisation of the historicity of philosophy.
