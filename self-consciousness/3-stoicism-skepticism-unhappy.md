### Stoicism, Skepticism, and the Unhappy Consciousness {#stoic}
#### Freedom of Self-Consciousness {.subtitle}

Here is where the last chapter has left us: the master has imposed the demands
of their desire onto the slave, and has thus become a repetitive consumer. The
master is never satisfied, because they continue to destroy (i.e., consume) the
objects of their desire, and they are also are not free, because they rely so
constantly on the work of the slave. Freedom requires intelligent
self-sufficiency, Hegel claims, just as Spinoza had recognised in the *Ethics*:

> That thing is said to be free [*liber*] which exists solely from the
> of its own nature, and is determined to action by itself alone.[^52]

The slave, on the other hand, has moved towards freedom by expressing their
subjectivity through work, imposing their identity on an object and thereby
'solidifying' it. Nonetheless, the slave is not yet entirely free, because they
still depend somewhat upon the object. Because the slave's work was demanded by
the master, the slave still sees the master as the essential being -- that is,
the subject -- in the situation. The slave hasn't yet understood what we, the
phenomenological observers, realise: that the crafted object's very *form* is
bestowed upon it by the slave, and that the slave is therefore the substance of
the object. As Kalkavage puts it, we recognise that 'the substance of things is
their relation to the thinking subject or consciousness'.[^53]

What kind of self-consciousness *can* realise this? What kind of character is
able to recognise that they are self-sufficient and autonomous, with no need to
refer to a master, a Beyond, or a mundane thing? And what kind of activity would
this character be involved in? Hegel's answer is: the **stoic** and **thought
itself**.

While the slave was tied to the object, and found independence only through
recognising themselves in the object, the stoic's thinking is concerned with
*concepts* instead of objects. This, after all, is what thinking really is;
while the slave and the master obviously had *thoughts*, they had them only in a
limited and dependent sense. As Harris describes them, 'Being human, they both
think, but they think finitely, and in *Vorstellungen* [representations]. Their
thoughts have external referents, and are not the comprehensive grasping of
completely intellectual contents (the UnderÂ­ standing's concept of Force was the
first "pure thought" that we had to deal with)'.[^54] That is to say, free
thought -- which is precisely what the stoic practices -- operates not
'according to representations or shapes but rather in *concepts*, which is to
say, the object moves itself within a differentiated being-in-itself, which for
consciousness is not anything immediately differentiated from it'.[^55] Because
a concept is *purely* mental, and makes no attempt to represent objects separate
from consciousness, it is always *my own*. Miller's translation has a useful
phrase with which to contrast the stoic's thinking: it never manifests as
'picture-thought'. This kind of thinking is free precisely because it is
self-sufficient, and relies merely on the self alone. It might seem, therefore,
like a precursor to Descartes' self-reliant *cogito*. In thinking, consciousness
is 'an object to itself'; 'its meaning is that of the *being-for-itself* of that
consciousness [who thinks]'.[^56] As the object of free thought, the concept is
a *thing* of sorts (a 'determinate and distinguished existent', in Hegel's
words), but it is never a *represented* thing; it is never something other than
consciousness.

> In that this content [of the stoic's thought] is at the same time a
> conceptually grasped content, consciousness remains *immediately* self-aware
> of its unity with this determinate and distinguished existent, not as it would
> be in the case of representation, in which consciousness especially has to
> remind itself that this is *its* representation; rather, the concept is to me
> immediately *my* concept.[^57]

Hegel summarises the stoic's freedom when he says that 'within thinking, I am
*free* because I am not in an other ... my moving about in concepts is a
movement within myself'.[^58] As such, the stoic is neither a naive master, who
finds their truth in the slave, nor a slave, whose truth is found in serving the
master. Hegel is perhaps thinking of how the two masters of stoicism (Marcus
Aurelius and Epictetus) were an emperor and a slave, respectively, when he says
that stoicism 'consists in being free within all the dependencies of one's
singular existence, *whether on the throne or in fetters*'. The stoic
*withdraws* from 'actual doing', from 'suffering', and from life itself, 'and
*withdraws* into *the simple essentiality of thought*'.[^59]

As has happened before in the *Phenomenology*, the language we use to describe
our grasp on truth has overtaken us; the very words used in describing
stoicism's *strength* give a voice to its *weaknesses*. To be specific, stoicism
has prided itself on its *withdrawal* from life into the *immediacy* of
self-consciousness's own concepts, but by doing this, it has '*let go of natural
existence*' and cast itself into a state of purely internal reflection.[^60] The
comparison with Descartes can thus continue in a critical direction: it seems
that the stoic has ended up trapped as the famous 'ghost in the machine'.[^61]
To be sure, the stoic is an adept thinker, but in stoicism, Hegel writes,
'thought only has *pure thoguhts* as its truth, a truth without any fulfillment
in life'; as such, the 'freedom' that the stoic held onto so proudly is 'not
living freedom itself but only the concept of freedom'.[^62] What good is
freedom if it isn't exercised against the grip of life and its suffering? There
is no real *content* to a stoic's thinking -- only concepts reflected in other
concepts. Furthermore, this empty and formalistic thinking even falls into
contradiction when it is asked for the criterion of truth:

> To the question put to it, "*What* is good and true?", its answer was once
> more that it was the abstract thinking *devoid of all content itself*, namely,
> that the true and the good is supposed to consist in rationality. However,
> this self-equality of thinking is only again the pure form in which nothing is
> determinate.

That is to say, there can be no real truth in thought that has no content. There
is nothing against which the stoic's thinking can be tested; as such, all
high-minded reference the stoic makes to 'truth', 'the good', and so on,
eventually dissolves.

> The general terms, "true" and "good", or "wisdom" and "virtue", with which
> stoicism is stuck, are on the whole undeniably uplifting, but because they
> cannot in fact end up in any kind of expansion of content, they quickly start
> to become tiresome.[^63]
