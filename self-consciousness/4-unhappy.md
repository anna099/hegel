### Unhappy Consciousness {#unhappy}
#### Freedom of Self-Consciousness, Part Two {.subtitle}

The unhappiness of this stage in the development of self-consciousness is easy
enough to understand. As Robert Stern writes, 'on the one hand, the Unhappy
Consciousness believes that it is unable to transcend the world of changeable
appearances, but on the other hand holds that it can only attain satisfaction by
so doing'.[^84] As such, consciousness has given up on the quest for *ataraxia*,
or any sort of satisfaction; instead, it is withdrawn to a sad admission of its
own finitude. The unhappy consciousness takes the two parts of skepticism's
doubled state -- the 'changeable consciousness' of contingent, finite existence,
and the 'unchangeable consciousness' that was desired -- and posits the latter
as an unreachable, divine individual. That is to say, the unhappy consciousness
does not realise that this double *is itself*; rather, it projects a part of
itself onto a separate, imaginary being: 'an opaque sensuous *One* possessing
all the aloofness of *something actual*'.[^85] As Hegel explains, the unhappy
consciousness 'both brings together and keeps together pure thinking and
singular individuality, but it has not yet been elevated to that thinking *for
which* the singular individuality of consciousness is reconciled with pure
thinking itself'. Just as self-consciousness started out with desire, here it is
still agonised with the desire to be like the 'unchangeable', 'other-worldly'
*One* that it has some awareness of ... and yet it fails to realise that this
object 'is *it itself*, is itself the singularity of consciousness'.[^86]

As Judith Butler points out, this stage of self-consciousness sees the tension
between mastery and servitude take place within one single subject:

> The bondsman takes the place of the lord by recognizing his own formative
> capacity, but once the lord is displaced, the bondsman becomes lord over
> himself, more specifically, lord over his own body; this form of
> reflexivity signals the passage from bondage to unhappy consciousness.[^87]

For Butler, the *body* in which self-consciousness resides is the prime example
of the particularity and contingency which makes for the unhappiness in unhappy
consciousness. Previously, Hegel compared skeptics to 'stubborn children' who
take delight in negating anything that the Other says. Now, Butler explains,
'the childish and stubborn pleasure that the skeptic takes in watching another
fall turns into a profound unhappiness when he is, as it were, forced to watch
himself [as unhappy consciousness] fall into endless contradictions'.[^88] To
continue the analysis of unhappy consciousness as *split*, then, we can say that
the side of this split who takes the place of the master -- the 'unchangeable
consciousness' -- acts out of sadomasochism upon the enslaved side of the split,
the 'changeable consciousness' that the body is taken to represent. As Butler
puts it, 'the subject subordinates its own body in the service of the thought
of the unchangeable'.[^89]

The unhappy consciousness is the final stage in self-consciousness, before the
*Phenomenology* moves on to 'Reason'. The unhappiness of self-consciousness at
this stage is, as Jean Wahl realises, the sign of 'absolute negativity' becoming
'fully aware of itself' for the first time.[^90] With this awareness, Wahl
argues, the project of the *Phenomenology* really begins -- that is, 'the
narration of consciousness's efforts to fill in the separations that it feels
within itself'. Consciousness could only be happy if it were to become
conscious of its unity; instead, it is currently stuck as '*the vision of one
consciousness in another*'.[^91] The unhappy subject has not yet realised that
they are the unity of contradictions.

#### Judaism and Christianity {#juda}

Jean Wahl makes an observation which is now becoming increasingly evident: the
unhappy consciousness represents, in a basic form, the foundations of Abrahamic
religion. While self-consciousness fails to realise that the divine unchangeable
is, in fact, *within it* -- while it is 'the inward movement of the *pure* heart
which painfully *feels* itself as estranged' -- its unhappy thinking is a form
of '*devotion*'.[^92] As Wahl writes, the same is true in Judaism:

> Jewish consciousness knows its contradiction. It turns out to be the deepening
> of Scepticism and the still incomplete unification of that which remains
> separated in Scepticism. It is the religion of the sublime in which the
> essential and the inessential are most firmly opposed to each other, but in
> which they are also shown in their reciprocal necessity.[^93]

Why *Judaism* specifically? Does Christianity not also estrange the believer
from God, reducing human life to the unhappy experience of lack? To be sure,
there are important Christian philosophers who characterise the unhappy
consciousness. For instance, Augustine addresses his *Confessions* to a God that
is 'incorruptible'; in his conversion, Augustine is led to a realisation -- a
'single truth [which] was the only weapon with which I could try to drive from
my mind's eye all the unclean images which swarmed before it' -- namely, 'that
what remains constant is better than that which is changeable ... the
incorruptible is better than the corruptible'.[^94] Pascal is even closer to
Hegel's description of the unhappy consciousness, claiming that 'Man's greatness
lies in his capacity to recognize his wretchedness'.[^95] Just like Hegel's
unhappy subject, Pascal positions his unhappiness as a successor to stoicism:

> The stoics say: 'Go back into yourselves. There you will find peace.' And it
> is not true. Others say: 'Go out, look for happiness in some distraction.' And
> that is not true. Illness is the result. Happiness is neither outside us nor
> within us. It is in God, and both outside and within us.[^96]

Nonetheless, two things (in my judgment) make Judaism a more appropriate
representative of the unhappy consciousness, at least in its first stage.
Firstly, and most simply, Judaism chronologically precedes Christianity. Thus,
any consciousness of the separation of humanity and divinity in *Christianity*
can be seen as a derivation of Jewish thought. For Jean Hyppolite, Judaism was
the foremost representative of this separation-thinking; he's reported to have
said during wartime that 'insofar as we seek the universal, we are all
Jews'.[^97] Secondly, one of the crucial events in Christianity -- the
incarnation of God as Jesus -- marks a *denial* of this separation, as God (the
unchangeable) takes the changeable form of a man, who undergoes the greatest act
of finitude in the crucifixion.

... And yet, it is the crucifixion that takes Jesus back out of the changeable
world. To understand the consequence of this, the meaning of the crucifixion to
the unhappy consciousness, we will make a diversion through Hegel's analysis of
*feeling*.

The object of unhappy consciousness's focus -- that is, the unchangeable -- is
so separate from consciousness that, as Harris puts it, 'the Unhappy
Consciousness does not *properly think* but *feels*'.[^98] The encounter between
changeable and unchangeable, insofar as there is one, is one of silence. No
matter how much I call out, God does not reply. 'As such', Hegel writes, 'its
thinking remains that of the shapeless roar of the pealing of bells, or that of
a warm, all-suffusing vapor, or that of a musical thinking which does not amount
to concepts'.[^99] Consider a scene from Ingmar Bergman's *The Seventh Seal*:

> **Knight**: I want to talk to you as openly as I can, but my heart is empty
> ... The emptiness is a mirror turned towards my own face. I see myself in it,
> and I am filled with fear and disgust.

> **Death** does not answer. *[silence]*[^100]

Here, the knight is an example of unhappy consciousness. He wants to make sense
of his contingent existence through dialogue with a being *beyond* such
existence, and yet standing before this being he realises his own 'emptiness'.
Just like the slave before the master, he is 'filled with fear' when he realises
his changeable existence, his contingency.

But why does the knight direct his confession -- his devotion, or 'shapeless
roar' -- to death, and not God? Hegel has the answer. The aforementioned event
of the crucifixion effects a transformation in unhappy reliigous thinking,
namely, that 'the singular being who was God is dead'.[^101] This is the
biblical story, at any rate. In rather abstract terms, Hegel describes the
logical structure of this transformation:

> Where the other [God, the unchangeable, etc.] is sought, it cannot be found,
> for it is just supposed to be *an other-worldly beyond*, or the kind of thing
> that cannot be found. Sought as individual [Jesus], it turns out not to be a
> *universal singular individuality* of thought, or it turns out not to be a
> *concept* but rather to be the *singular individual* as an object, or as an
> actuality, an object of immediate sense certainty. Just for that reason, it
> thus turns out only to be the kind of thing that has vanished.[^102]

In other words, because the unchangeable is taken to be an 'other-worldly
beyond', any worldly appearance of it must be as fleeting as the 'This-Here-Now'
of sensuous certainty. In religion, Jesus was this fleeting appearance, and the
crucifixion marked him as 'the kind of thing that has vanished'. Thus, all that
remains for consciousness to devote itself to is the '*grave*' of God.[^103]

#### The Subject's Return to Work {#work}

The unhappy subject is thus left in an abandoned world, the grave of a crucified
God. As such, just like the slave who was left alone with their labour, the
unhappy subject undergoes 'the *return of the heart into itself*': now that God
has gone, self-consciousness turns to itself as an object.[^104] This begins the
second stage of unhappy consciousness, in which -- again, like the slave -- it
seeks to overcome its alienation through desire and labour. Through work, the
subject hopes to prove itself; however, Hegel admits, this will result in 'only
the proof of the worth of what it is for itself, namely, its
estrangement'.[^105]

There is of course a difference between the work of the slave and the work of
the unhappy consciousness: now, the object worked upon is not just something
desired by a master, but the world itself. The world, like the subject, is
split: it is both *empty*, having been abandoned by God, and *sacred*, being
God's divine creation. It is, in Hegel's words, 'an *actuality at odds with
itself*':

> This actuality is a shape of the unchangeable, for the latter has preserved
> singular individuality in itself, and because, as the unchangeable, it is the
> universal, the meaning of its singular individuality itself is that of
> all actuality.[^106]

Understood this way, the world is indeed a metaphorical *grave*, because a grave
is both a marker of somebody's absence, a sign of their having left this world,
and a concrete record of their having existed. A grave is a sign that the person
whose absence it marks will, in fact, live on through the materialisation of
their life. Thus the world is God's grave, the sign left behind by God; and the
subject works upon it -- transforms and consumes it -- in order to come closer
to God. Now, even at this point, the unhappy subject is still not entirely
self-sufficient. If it were, and if the world were purely null, then the
subject's work would 'sublate actuality' and result in satisfaction: namely, the
feeling or realisation of self-sufficiency. However, since the world is split
and contains the unchangeable as its essence or form (it is, 'to itself, the
shape of the unchangeable', as Hegel explains), the subject's labour sublates
the world only insofar as 'the unchangeable itself *surrenders* its shape and
*hands it over* to consciousness to consume'.[^107] Of course, the subject is
also split, with its 'powers' -- its capacity to work upon the world --
being seemingly derived from the other-worldly beyond. That is to say, insofar
as the subject is at all able to affect a world whose essence is the
unchangeable, the subject's power to do so must be an 'alien gift' from the
unchangeable itself.[^108]

The splitting of both the world and the subject is essential for desire and work
to have any significance, for without the unchangeable elements within each of
them, the subject would merely be 'an active this-worldliness, confronted by
passive actuality'.[^109] The world only 'gives itself over', so to speak,
because its unchangeable essence 'repels' its changeable existence. Likewise,
the subject also surrenders itself; since the satisfied feeling of
self-sufficiency is not possible, the subject's work instead takes the shape of
'giving thanks' to the unchangeable *'beyond'* that has bestowed it with powers
and a world to confront.[^110]
