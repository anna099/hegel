## Self-Consciousness

### Desire

The *Phenomenology*'s chapter on self-consciousness marks a turning point in the
book; in some sense, everything that follows is an examination of
self-consciousness. At the opening of the chapter, Hegel remarks that 'in the
preceding kinds of certainty, the truth for consciousness is *something other
than consciousness itself*'.[^1] Sensuous certainty gave way to perception,
which gave way to the understanding, and these overcomings occurred because 'the
concept of the truth vanishes in the experience of it'.[^2] That is to say, each
stage of knowing posits a particular concept (whether that is the This, the One,
or force) as *absolute*, certain truth. As experience undermined the truth of
these concepts, eventually consciousness came to recognise *itself* as the
movement of concepts. Thus, for the first time, consciousness is its own object.
Just as before, consciousness is making a claim to absolute truth; this time, it
asserts consciousness itself as absolute truth. The claim of self-consciousness,
to start with, is therefore: *'That which cannot be doubted is that I am
myself.'*

This is likely to remind us of Descartes' *cogito*. But it is even more
reminiscent of Kant's idealism, which Hyppolite summarises in the formula:
'Self-consciousness is the truth of consciousness'.[^3] For Kant, the only way
we can possibly ascertain knowledge is if the conditions of the object are equal
to the conditions of the subject; in other words, the structure of the world
must match the structure of consciousness. Thus, knowledge of the world is also
knowledge of the self. As Hegel himself remarked, at the end of the previous
chapter, 'there is so much self-satisfaction in explanation, because the
consciousness involved in it is, to put it this way, in an immediate
conversation with itself, enjoying only itself'.[^4] So, in 'enjoying itself',
self-consciousness imposes itself on the whole world around it. That *I am
myself* is, for self-consciousness, the highest level of truth.  And yet, there
is a kind of shallowness to the bare claim that *I am myself*. Far back in
sensuous certainty, there was already a conception -- albeit a primitive one --
of the I as a This which apprehends the being of a sensuous object. In a sense,
the 'self' had existed implicitly throughout the *Phenomenology*'s section on
consciousness, if only as the hidden being who holds certainty, perceptive
content, or explanations of force to be true. Does this section on
self-consciousness simply develop an analysis of this hidden being, bringing it
into the foreground, or is it a new kind of analysis altogether?

In response to this issue of the continuity between the *consciousness*
and *self-consciousness* chapters, some interpretations have essentially
ignored Hegel's first three chapters, deeming them to be inessential to
the *Phenomenology*'s apparently central task of philosophical
anthropology.[^5] Others have suggested that there is a close continuity
from the first three chapters into the fourth. John McDowell, for
example, understands the present chapter on self-consciousness as a
continuation of the analysis of dependence and independence in the
context of subject and object; an analysis which is indebted to Kant's
revolutionary discovery that experience is neither the independent
invention or imposition of the subject, nor the passive and receptive
dependency on the object. When Hegel identifies self-consciousness with
desire, therefore, McDowell interprets it as a way for consciousness to
incorporate that which at first is purely other; he understands the
struggle for recognition as the struggle between various ways of
consciousness negotiating between dependence and independence. Thus, for
McDowell, this fourth chapter largely continues the project of the
section on consciousness, and introduces nothing overtly social or
anthropological.[^6]

But what if we avoid such *allegorical* interpretations, and instead
take Hegel at his word? At the opening of the chapter, Hegel introduces
two crucial claims about self-consciousness: firstly, that insofar as it
'*only* distinguishes *itself* from itself', self-consciousness is
merely a 'motionless tautology'; secondly, that 'self-consciousness is
*desire*'.[^7] These two premises, I think, are essentially linked: the
otherness that desire involves (since desire is always desire for an
other) is what gives self-consciousness its *determinate* content,
setting it apart from mere tautology.

#### The Dependency of Selfhood {#depen}

In order for self-consciousness to actually express something beyond tautology
-- that is, in order for it to *really be* self-consciousness -- it must
recognise an Other for the sake of distinguishing itself from the Other. (We saw
this same route to determinacy in *Perception*, when consciousness posited the
thing as an 'excluding One'.) Thus, 'I am myself' must become something like, 'I
am *not you*'. This negation of the Other is no ordinary negation, but a
*sublation* -- a determinate negation -- that, in negating the Other, affirms
the self. 'Self-consciousness is therefore only certain of itself through the
sublating of this other'.[^8] Now, this sublation which affirms the self is, in
fact, the acting-out of desire. To understand this, recall Hegel's remark
regarding animals and the Eleusinian mysteries in the first chapter of the
*Phenomenology*: when animals naturally come to desire food, 'they without
further ado simply help themselves to them and devour them'; likewise, Ceres and
Bacchus take up the drinks at their mysteries and 'bring about their
nothingness'.[^9] In both scenarios, the outcome of desire is the *annihilation*
of the desired object. At this moment, however, a dilemma arises within
self-consciousness: 'For this sublating even to be, there must be this
other'.[^10] That is to say, the self is conscious of itself only by sublating
the Other, but as soon as the Other is sublated, it is gone: there is nothing
left to sublate, and therefore nothing left through which the self can identify
itself.
