### Mastery and Servitude {#master}
#### Self-Sufficiency and Non-Self-Sufficiency of Self-Consciousness {.subtitle}

The present section is possibly the most-read passage in all of Hegel's work,
though it lasts less than ten pages. At the opening, Hegel explains that
self-consciousness is only '*in* and *for itself*' -- that is, it is only fully
manifest in its complete logical form -- when it is 'a *recognized* being'.[^20]
Hegel's sense of recognition relies upon a typically Hegelian contradiction: it
is the process by which spiritual *unity* emerges out of a *doubling*. As I
understand it, this logic of recognition bears a similarity to the logic of
force in the previous chapter. Recall that, in asserting itself, force reaches
outside of itself and presses up against an external force. In Hyppolite's
words, force is 'the unity of itself and its externalization'.[^21] In the same
way, 'self-consciousness is *outside of itself*'.[^22] Just as a force is
manifest only insofar as it comes into contact with another force, so too does
self-consciousness only exist insofar as it is *recognised to exist* by an
Other. The process of 'reaching out' and being recognised is like a reflection:
first, self-consciousness 'loses itself' in the Other, recognising them; second,
it *sublates* the Other, and recognises them recognising it. Think of somebody
looking into a mirror: they first recognise the image, and then they recognise
that the image is an image of themselves. In both the Hegelian process of
recognition, and the process of looking into a mirror, the self-consciousness
returns into itself by negating the otherness (either the Other or the
mirror-image). 'It gets itself back through sublation, for it comes to be in
equality with itself again through the sublation of *its* otherness'.[^23]

The peculiarity that arises here is that being conscious of one's self is not,
and can never be, a purely singular activity. It necessarily involves a
self-sufficient Other, who themselves is engaged in self-consciousness, by
involving an Other ... and so on. Each consciousness 'himself does what he
demands of the other and for that reason also does what he does *only* insofar
as the other does the same'.[^24] Both consciousnesses -- both 'extremes' in the
dialectical process -- *reach out*, and in so doing, *withdraw* back into
themselves. My self-consciousness, my internality, *is externality*. This is the
act of mutual recognition: the act wherein the unity of self-consciousness
arises from its doubling. As Hegel writes, 'what is supposed to happen can only
be brought about through both of [the self-consciousnesses] bringing it about';
that is to say, the realisation of the self only happens when both parties, both
consciousnesses, recognise each other in the same way.

> demands of the other and for that reason also does what he does *only* insofar

#### The Trial of Subjectivity {#trial}

Hegel acknowledges that the stable mediation of mutual recognition does not come
about immediately; like all other moments in the *Phenomenology*, it is a
process. The I and the Other first start as 'extremes', opposed to each other,
and when recognition first emerges, it will be only in one direction.

At first, the I is a singular being, experienced immediately, asserted in its
self-equality by opposition to the Other. 'What is other for it,' Hegel writes,
'is, as an inessential object, designated by the character of the
negative'.[^26] That is to say, the Other is at this point merely a simple
object, depersonalised and exploited by the I for the sake of the I's certainty
of itself. The I is not yet *self-consciousness*, because it is still asserted
as something *immediate*; since it doesn't yet acknowledge itself as *mediated*
through a self-sufficient Other, it remains in the Hobbesian state of 'restless
desire'. To escape this state, and to realise itself *as a self*, as a subject,
the I must move beyond the immediacy of self-certainty and, recognising itself
as mediated by an equally mediated Other, show 'that it is not at all bound to
the universal singularity of existence, that it is not shackled to life'.[^27]

Dramatically, this process evolves into a **trial by death**: the I that wants
to be seen as a subject is ultimately willing to sacrifice their own life, and
take the life of the Other, in order to have their subjectivity recognised. Why?
In the first case, in the fight to count as a *subject*, and not merely a living
thing, the I is willing to give up everything *objective* about their existence:
they will readily bring about 'the destruction of all immediate being',
revealing their pure subjectivity as 'the pure negation of [their] objective
mode'.[^28] If I put my life at stake, I am asserting my subjectivity, by
demonstrating that my existence is determined by my own will. As Hegel writes in
the *Philosophy of Right*,

> As a person, I at the same time possess *my life and body*, like other things,
> only *in so far as I so will it*. â€¦ I have these limbs and my life only *in so
> far as I will it*; the animal cannot mutilate or destroy itself, but the human
> being can.[^29]

In order to demonstrate its freedom and subjectivity, therefore, the I is
willing to devote itself to the ultimate act of freedom: facing the risk of
death. Now, as well as demonstrating the control I have over my existence, the
*conflict* that must necessarily arise alongside the risk of death reveals the
brave claim of subjectivity: my subjectivity, my freedom, is such that it can be
*defended* in a situation of conflict and thus be 'proven' as *true* and
universal. As Frantz Fanon writes, willingly facing the risk of death 'means
that I go beyond life toward a supreme good that is the transformation of
subjective certainty of my own worth into a *universally valid objective
truth*'.[^30]

In the situation of conflict, the I is not only defending themselves, but is
even prepared to kill the Other, who also wants to assert themselves as
independent, and in so doing threatens the independence of the I. In this
reasoning there is a profound critique of Hobbes, for whom the primary *trial by
death* in human life takes place in the state of nature, where individuals
attack others to satisfy their desires and gain reputation. For Hobbes, humans
are -- 'by a real necessity of nature' -- drawn to 'shun death'; the Hobbesian
individual values *self-preservation* above all else, and would never risk death
solely for the sake of freedom, as the Hegelian self-consciousness does.[^31]

#### The Rise of the Master {#rise}

Eventually, someone must win the trial by death by killing their opponent. But
this success turns into a failure when the 'winner' no longer has a living Other
to provide them with recognition. Thus, Hegel explains, the trial 'sublates the
truth which was supposed to emerge from it'.[^32] Once it finally comes to this
realisation, self-consciousness tries to attain stable recognition not through
killing the Other, but by *enslaving* them. We thus arrive at the first concrete
human relation in the *Phenomenology of Spirit*: that of the master and the
slave.

In his *Politics*, Aristotle defines a slave as a person who is the *possession*
of another:

> Hence we see what is the nature and office of a slave; he who is by nature not
> his own but another's man, is by nature a slave; and he may be said to be
> another's man who, being a human being, is also a possession. And a possession
> may be defined as an instrument of action, separable from the possessor.[^33]

Hegel is not interested in justifying slavery, as Aristotle was, but nonetheless
their analyses have important similarities: just as Aristotle sees the slave as
'an instrument of action', so too does Hegel recognise that the slave as a kind
of 'outsourcing' of the master's desire. As Kalkavage describes it, 'the slave
*works on things* in order to satisfy the natural desire of the master'.[^34]
When a self-consciousness has become a master, they are thereby in the position
to act upon their desire by mediating it through the action of the slave, and,
as such, they no longer have to worry about their object of desire being
nullified. The negation of the desired object -- that is, the *satisfaction of
desire* -- is ensured by the servitude of the slave, rather than by
annihilation. As Hegel puts it, the slave only counts as a negative for the
master.[^35] Furthermore, the master is no longer burdened with the burdens of
the aforementioned 'objective mode' of selfhood; the weaknesses of the body, for
instance, are no challenge to somebody who employs the body of another to do
their dirty work.

With this new capacity of control, the master is able to work on the world, to
*control* the world, without having to negate everything in their path. As
Harris points out, the master is not a God, but is more akin to an Adam who has
become 'God-like': the master (or 'Lord')

> simply enjoys the world; but it does not hear his word immediately, as Heaven
> and Earth sprang from nothing when God spoke "in the beginning." The serf
> [slave] is the middle term between them. Hearing the Lord's word, he works on
> the world, to bring it into harmony with the Lord's will. The human Lord is
> Adam who has become "like God"; he is not expelled from Eden after all,
> because *he eats his bread in the sweat of another's brow*.[^36]

As Hegel explains, the slave is a 'middle term' between the master and the
object of desire. Only the 'non-self-sufficiency' -- the 'consumable' aspect --
of the desired thing is of any interest to the master; the self-sufficient,
objective mode of the thing -- its very *thinghood* -- is left 'in the care of
the servant'.[^37]

> The Lord showed himself to be 'like God' in the struggle; and the other
> learned to fear him accordingly. ... It is the element of *fear* in the relation
> of lord and serf that constitutes the sublated survival of the life and death
> struggle in this new relationship. The 'knowledge of good and evil' is the
> knowledge of who is afraid of death and who is not.[^38]

The slave does as the master commands, because the only other option is to risk
their life again in another trial by death. The slave is therefore in a similar
position to a religious devotee: fear God (the master), or face damnation.
Everything the slave does is done out of fear of death; in effect, then, it is
done out of *necessity*. As such, 'what the servant does is really the master's
doing'.[^39] The slave has essentially become an extension of the master's
capacity, like an artificial limb. It is here that an issue arises; for, in the
quest for recognition, what good is this 'limb' -- an 'inessential doing',
dependent upon another, with little regard for itself? What God would care for a
'devotee' who has no choice but to believe? The master has denigrated the slave
so much, and has reduced its self-sufficiency to such an extent, that any
'recognition' that the slave can provide is worthless. 'As a result, a form of
recognition has arisen that is one-sided and unequal'.[^40] We consequently
arrive at a point of dialectical inversion: 'the *truth* of the self-sufficient
consciousness [the master] is thus the *servile consciousness*'; yet again, a
claim to truth has shown itself to be the *inversion* of what it proclaims
itself to be.[^41] The master has effectively refused any recognition, by
objectifying the Other who could recognise them; furthermore, the master is
entirely *dependent* on their slave's work, and is thus a slave themselves.

#### The Liberation of the Slave {#liber}

The master is a consumer, who makes demands of the slave and then consumes the
products of the slave's work. In this sense, the master is still ruled by
desire. A product is desired, demanded, and then consumed; and through this
consumption, the master 'has reserved to itself the pure negating of the
object'.[^42] The master's satisfaction is thus always transitory. The life of
the slave, on the other hand, is ruled not by desire but by *work*, which Hegel
describes as 'desire *held in check*'.[^43] The slave works upon a thing, but
doesn't consume it. As such, the object for the slave is something that endures;
it is a stable existence upon which a slave can assert themselves, contrasting
to the ever-vanishing objects of consumption that the master has to continuously
demand. In leaving their mark upon these enduring objects, the slave gets closer
to realising their true subjectivity; 'through work, this servile consciousness
comes round to itself ... work *cultivates and educates* [*bildet*]'.[^44]

Work is only one of three ways in which the slave liberates themselves. *Fear*
also plays a role, as Hegel makes reference to the claim in *Proverbs*, 'the
fear of the <span class="sc">Lord</span> is the beginning of wisdom'.[^45] In
the oppressive condition of servitude, the slave 'had anxiety about its entire
essence. It felt the fear of death, the absolute master'.[^46] In this state of
anxiety, 'all stable existence becomes absolutely fluid'; the slave is forced to
acknowledge that life is temporary and the body degrades. As Heidegger would
later understand, fear and anxiety cause the world to slip away, leaving us
alone with what Hegel calls the *simple essence of self-consciousness*: 'anxiety
leaves us hanging because it induces the slipping away of beings as a whole ...
In the altogether unsettling experience of this hovering where there is nothing
to hold onto, pure Dasein is all that is still there'.[^47] In other words, the
fear inherent in slavery allows the slave to shrug off everything that is
temporary, all of 'natural existence', and confront the subjective truth of
their self-consciousness -- the self-consciousness that they have cultivated,
and imprinted on the world, in their labour.

The third part in the slave's liberation is the 'service' which the slave
provides to the master. As Hegel explains, fear causes the dissolution of the
slave's natural existence from the subjective perspective: in anxiety, the slave
sees the temporary, inessential parts of their world and existence slip away. In
*service*, however, 'the servant also achieves this dissolution *in
actuality*'.[^48] In serving the master, the slave *actually* gives over the
ownership of their natural existence; as Kalkavage writes, 'in service, I give
up my claim to all natural existence: to food and drink, procreation, even
sleep'.[^49] In so doing, the slave realises their *independence* from this
natural existence; they no longer have authority over their body or any of its
activity, and yet something that is truly their own still remains: their
independent self-consciousness.

Hegel's famous master-slave dialectic thus comes to an end as we discover that,
in Hyppolite's words, 'The path of mastery is a dead end in human experience;
the path of servitude is the true path of human liberation.'[^50] The master is
left behind in history, endlessly repeating the demands of unsatisfied desire;
the slave, on the other hand, has discovered their independent
self-consciousness, brought to light through the trauma of fear and service, and
they have imprinted it on the world in their work. The slave has mastered the
'labor of the negative',[^51] negating things not by destroying their form (as
in desire), but by *transforming* them. In the beginning, serving the master
leads a slave to be a stranger to themselves. But through work, they imprint
themselves upon the world, and thus eventually see themselves looking back.
