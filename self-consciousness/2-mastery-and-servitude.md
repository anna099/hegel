### Mastery and Servitude {#master}
#### Self-Sufficiency and Non-Self-Sufficiency of Self-Consciousness {.subtitle}

The present section is possibly the most-read passage in all of Hegel's work,
though it lasts less than ten pages. At the opening, Hegel explains that
self-consciousness is only '*in* and *for itself*' -- that is, it is only fully
manifest in its complete logical form -- when it is 'a *recognized* being'.[^20]
Hegel's sense of recognition relies upon a typically Hegelian contradiction: it
is the process by which spiritual *unity* emerges out of a *doubling*. As I
understand it, this logic of recognition bears a similarity to the logic of
force in the previous chapter. Recall that, in asserting itself, force reaches
outside of itself and presses up against an external force. In Hyppolite's
words, force is 'the unity of itself and its externalization'.[^21] In the same
way, 'self-consciousness is *outside of itself*'.[^22] Just as a force is
manifest only insofar as it comes into contact with another force, so too does
self-consciousness only exist insofar as it is *recognised to exist* by an
Other. The process of 'reaching out' and being recognised is like a reflection:
first, self-consciousness 'loses itself' in the Other, recognising them; second,
it *sublates* the Other, and recognises them recognising it. Think of somebody
looking into a mirror: they first recognise the image, and then they recognise
that the image is an image of themselves. In both the Hegelian process of
recognition, and the process of looking into a mirror, the self-consciousness
returns into itself by negating the otherness (either the Other or the
mirror-image). 'It gets itself back through sublation, for it comes to be in
equality with itself again through the sublation of *its* otherness'.[^23]

The peculiarity that arises here is that being conscious of one's self is not,
and can never be, a purely singular activity. It necessarily involves a
self-sufficient Other, who themselves is engaged in self-consciousness, by
involving an Other ... and so on. Each consciousness 'himself does what he
demands of the other and for that reason also does what he does *only* insofar
as the other does the same'.[^24] Both consciousnesses -- both 'extremes' in the
dialectical process -- *reach out*, and in so doing, *withdraw* back into
themselves. My self-consciousness, my internality, *is externality*. This is the
act of mutual recognition: the act wherein the unity of self-consciousness
arises from its doubling. As Hegel writes, 'what is supposed to happen can only
be brought about through both of [the self-consciousnesses] bringing it about';
that is to say, the realisation of the self only happens when both parties, both
consciousnesses, recognise each other in the same way.

#### The Trial of Subjectivity {#trial}

Hegel acknowledges that the stable mediation of mutual recognition does not come
about immediately; like all other moments in the *Phenomenology*, it is a
process. The I and the Other first start as 'extremes', opposed to each other,
and when recognition first emerges, it will be only in one direction.

At first, the I is a singular being, experienced immediately, asserted in its
self-equality by opposition to the Other. 'What is other for it,' Hegel writes,
'is, as an inessential object, designated by the character of the
negative'.[^26] That is to say, the Other is at this point merely a simple
object, depersonalised and exploited by the I for the sake of the I's certainty
of itself. The I is not yet *self-consciousness*, because it is still asserted
as something *immediate*; since it doesn't yet acknowledge itself as *mediated*
through a self-sufficient Other, it remains in the Hobbesian state of 'restless
desire'. To escape this state, and to realise itself *as a self*, as a subject,
the I must move beyond the immediacy of self-certainty and, recognising itself
as mediated by an equally mediated Other, show 'that it is not at all bound to
the universal singularity of existence, that it is not shackled to life'.[^27]

Dramatically, this process evolves into a **trial by death**: the I that wants
to be seen as a subject is ultimately willing to sacrifice their own life, and
take the life of the Other, in order to have their subjectivity recognised. Why?
In the first case, in the fight to count as a *subject*, and not merely a living
thing, the I is willing to give up everything *objective* about their existence:
they will readily bring about 'the destruction of all immediate being',
revealing their pure subjectivity as 'the pure negation of [their] objective
mode'.[^28] If I put my life at stake, I am asserting my subjectivity, by
demonstrating that my existence is determined by my own will. As Hegel writes in
the *Philosophy of Right*,

> As a person, I at the same time possess *my life and body*, like other things,
> only *in so far as I so will it*. â€¦ I have these limbs and my life only *in so
> far as I will it*; the animal cannot mutilate or destroy itself, but the human
> being can.[^29]

In order to demonstrate its freedom and subjectivity, therefore, the I is
willing to devote itself to the ultimate act of freedom: facing the risk of
death. Furthermore, the I is prepared to kill the Other, who also wants to
assert themselves as independent, and in so doing threatens the independence of
the I. In this reasoning there is a profound critique of Hobbes, for whom the
primary *trial by death* in human life takes place in the state of nature, where
individuals attack others to satisfy their desires and gain reputation. For
Hobbes, humans are -- 'by a real necessity of nature' -- drawn to 'shun death';
the Hobbesian individual values *self-preservation* above all else, and would
never risk death solely for the sake of freedom, as the Hegelian
self-consciousness does.[^30]
