#### The Adventure of Individualism: The Law of the Heart and the Insanity of Self-Conceit {#heart}

As it is with every stage of development in the *Phenomenology*, some
individuals may remain in the Faustian world of pleasure and necessity. The
movement to this new kind of individualism, of 'the law of the heart', is not
necessary. 'The hedonist might well stay a hedonist, increasingly jaded and
self-destructive', Robert Solomon writes; 'he or she might become an absurdist,
a sadist, retreat to the asceticism of "Unhappy Consciousness" or throw oneself
into work or join the marines to learn some "discipline".'[^51]
