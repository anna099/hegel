[^1]: Solomon, *In the Spirit of Hegel*, p. 218.
[^2]: Peter Kalkavage (*The Logic of Desire*, p. 486) suggests that the parallel
  between *Consciousness* and *Observing Reason* can be understood as follows:

    > Observing reason in its first phase resembles sense-certainty in its
    > attentiveness to the Thises of organic nature. In its second phase, it
    > posits the rational self as a Thing with many properties -- properties for
    > which reason finds laws. And in its third phase, it repeats the
    > understanding in positing a distinction between essence (invisible
    > selfhood) and appearance (outward signs).

    More concisely, Inwood ('Commentary', p. 429) puts forward this suggestion:

    > Observing reason corresponds to sensory certainty in description, to
    > perception in the classification of organisms, and to understanding in its
    > search for laws.
