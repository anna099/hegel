#### The Adventure of Individualism: Pleasure and Necessity {#pleas}

<blockquote class="epigraph">All theories, dear friend, are gray; the golden tree of life is green. <footer>Mephistopheles (Goethe's Faust, 1808)</footer></blockquote>

The pleasure-seeking individual is modelled on Goethe's Faust. At the time of
writing the *Phenomenology*, Hegel would not have read the same *Faust* as us;
prior to 1808, only a 'fragment' of the text existed. Nonetheless, he would have
been familiar with the story of the scholarly man Faust who, having grown
disillusioned with his philosophical and scientific knowledge, makes deals with
the devil (Mephistopheles) so that he can 'be done with peddling empty words'
and 'feel brave enough to venture forth and bear earth's torments and its
joys.'[^38] Ultimately, Faust wants to find true love; he seems to find this in
Gretchen, but the result of their relationship is ruin and shame.

Hegel's passage on *Pleasure and Necessity* therefore describes the alienated
individual's '*first purpose*': 'to become conscious of oneself as a singular
essence within that other self-consciousness, or to make this other into
itself.'[^39]
