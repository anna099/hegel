#### The Adventure of Individualism: Pleasure and Necessity {#pleas}

<blockquote class="epigraph">All theories, dear friend, are gray; the golden tree of life is green. <footer>Mephistopheles (Goethe's Faust, 1808)</footer></blockquote>

The pleasure-seeking individual is modelled on Goethe's Faust. At the time of
writing the *Phenomenology*, Hegel would not have read the same *Faust* as us;
prior to 1808, only a 'fragment' of the text existed. Nonetheless, he would have
been familiar with the story of the scholarly man Faust who, having grown
disillusioned with his philosophical and scientific knowledge, makes a deal with
the devil (Mephistopheles) so that he can 'be done with peddling empty words'
and 'feel brave enough to venture forth and bear earth's torments and its
joys.'[^38] Ultimately, Faust wants to find the ultimate pleasure, namely, love;
he seems to find this in Gretchen, but the result of their relationship is ruin
and shame when Gretchen becomes accidentally pregnant and they unintentionally
kill her mother. (In this way, *Faust* is an inversion of the story of Adam and
Eve: Eve eats from the Tree of Knowledge, and the gift of knowledge leads to
ruin. Faust, on the other hand, rejects knowledge and seeks an Eden of pleasure,
and it is this pleasure that leads him to ruin.)

Hegel's passage on *Pleasure and Necessity* therefore describes the alienated
individual's '*first purpose*' as one of finding love: 'to become conscious of
oneself as a singular essence within that other self-consciousness, or to make
this other into itself.'[^39] The individual desires 'the intuition of the unity
of both self-sufficient self-consciousnesses' -- for instance, the unity of
Faust and Gretchen. In *Mastery and Servitude*, Hegel showed that an
individual's self-consciousness (their very awareness of self) is not possible
without recognition from another individual. In *Pleasure and Necessity*, he
shows that an individual's self-*actualisation* is not possible without their
recognising their situatedness in a greater whole: the social context
(responsibility) and the human context (mortality and death). The process by
which this takes place starts out with a Faustian 'plunge into life'; the
individual has abandoned 'the seemingly heavenly spirit' of observational
knowing and doing, and have succumbed to 'the spirit of the earth'.[^40] This is
a direct reference to the 'Erdgeist' in *Faust*, which Hegel describes as 'a
spirit to whom the only being which counts as the true actuality is that of the
actuality of singular consciousness.' The individual is now concerned only with
the particular, sensory things of this world insofar as they might satisfy one's
desire. Faust chooses the Earth over Heaven because the Earth is the natural
home of his body. It is for these reasons that Kalkavage refers to
pleasure-seeking individualism as 'the erotic version of sense-certainty.'[^41]

Hegel describes the abandonment of observational reason with all the Romantic
grandeur that this individualist idolises: 'out of the motionless being of
thinking', the pleasure-seeker has 'the law of ethos and existence, together
with the skills related to observation and theory, only as a gray and gradually
vanishing shadow behind it'.[^42] 'The shadows cast by science, laws, and
principles, which alone stand between it and its own actuality, vanish like a
lifeless fog', and the Faustian individual is left with a clean slate upon which
their self-actualisation can take place.[^43]

This actualisation is, as we have established, 'a doing of *desire*.' The
amorous individualist wants to obliterate the otherness of its object (the
love-interest); this, Hegel points out, is a little different to the more
primitive form of desire in the *Self-Consciousness* chapter, which started out
by wanting to obliterate its object as such -- to consume it, destroy it, and so
on. In *Pleasure and Necessity*, desire wants to be one with the Other: to
overcome its very *Other*-ness and witness it as the 'objectified selfhood' of
the desiring individual.[^44] This witnessing is the moment of pleasure.

The pleasurable unity of lovers 'positively signifies that [the individual] has
come to be objective self-consciousness *to itself*': now that there is love,
some real satisfaction has been found.[^45] However, this satisfaction only
takes the individual to a certain point. It is limited, and its limitation is
what it shares with the desire of the *Self-Consciousness* chapter. To start
with, pleasure is shared in a loving relationship, the *unity* of two selves.
However, such a relationship necessarily gives way to certain hardships -- for
instance, the accident of conception, or the realisation that your loved one
will die. These hardships fracture the unity of the relationship, and reveal the
way in which **necessity** takes precedence over pleasure-seeking. Life always
gives way to death; one cannot plunge into the former without eventually coming
to face the latter. When an individual realises this, they finally realise the
*social responsibility* that is inherent to self-actualisation.
'Self-recognizing pleasure reduces the agent self to a moment in a greater
whole', Harris writes.[^46] Self-actualisation cannot be achieved through
pleasure-seeking alone.

Andrew Cutrofello suggests that *Pleasure and Necessity* prefigures Foucault's
criticism of 'the repressive hypothesis' in *The History of Sexuality*.[^49.1]
Foucault argues against the prevalent hypothesis that (particularly in the
Victorian era) talk of sexuality is repressed by social authority and that,
consequently, expressing one's sexuality is socially subversive. In fact, he
claims, our very understanding of sexuality is socially constructed --
*conditioned* by these authorities we claim to subvert. Consequently, attempts
to express one's *pleasure* against a repressive *necessity* actually amounts to
one's *subsumption* under the discourse of that necessity. So, why does this
discourse of 'repression' come about? Cutrofello suggests that

> Hegel's answer is clear: because we live in an age in which we falsely define
> individuals as the simple opposite of society as a whole. We will see
> ourselves as repressed until we realize the inadequacy of defining ourselves
> in terms of the pleasure principle.[^49.2]

As such, although philosophers like Foucault like to criticise Hegel for
affirming self-consciousness by denying the alterity of others. We can see here
that Hegel does the very opposite: he shows that, in trying to affirm one's
pleasure against society's necessity, one actually ends up subsumed by that
necessity. Real self-recognition, we will see, comes about when the individual
*reconciles* themselves to the alterity of others. The individualist who looks
for some common essence in all humanity -- pleasure-seeking, in this instance --
will always fail for Hegel.

So, Faust's desire earns him some kind of relationship with Gretchen, but their
relationship never becomes something permanent and ethical; indeed, Gretchen
ends up being charged with murder after she drowns the illegitimate child she
had with Faust. Bound to Mephistopheles's pact, Faust is unable to pursue
anything beyond worldly pleasure, unable to truly integrate himself in a
community; in Robert Stern's words, 'pleasure-seeking now appears as an alien
constraint on his happiness, a kind of external necessity or fate which seems to
destroy him.'[^47] Hegel expresses this in logical terms by saying that the
Faustian individual's practice ultimately amounts to

> the further expansion of those empty essentialities, or of pure unity, of pure
> difference, and of their relation ... the simply and empty but nonetheless
> inexorable and impassive *relation* whose work is only the nothingness of
> singular individuality.[^48]

As a consequence, Hegel explains, the pleasure-seeker's 'plunge into life' has
ultimately been reversed: the individual has 'instead plunged into the
consciousness of its own lifelessness ... as *dead* actuality.' Hegel describes
this reversal as taking the individual from pure *being-for-itself* (the selfish
pleasure-seeker who 'has jettisoned all community') to pure *being-in-itself*
(the hard, basic actuality and 'lifeless necessity' of mortality, like the skull
that phrenology finds at the apex of observational reason).[^49]

Someone like Faust *feels* the reversal from the Eden of pleasure into the hell
of necessity, but does not *understand* it rationally. As such, here is the
point that we leave Faust behind. Only the individual who can recognise the fall
into necessity as the *inherent* outcome of pleasure -- someone who can
recognise the unavoidable death that awaits us at the end of life -- can reverse
this reversal and 'know necessity as itself', thereby progressing to a new shape
of individualism.[^50]
