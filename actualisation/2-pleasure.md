#### The Adventure of Individualism: Pleasure and Necessity {#pleas}

<blockquote class="epigraph">All theories, dear friend, are gray; the golden tree of life is green. <footer>Mephistopheles (Goethe's Faust, 1808)</footer></blockquote>

The pleasure-seeking individual is modelled on Goethe's Faust. At the time of
writing the *Phenomenology*, Hegel would not have read the same *Faust* as us;
prior to 1808, only a 'fragment' of the text existed. Nonetheless, he would have
been familiar with the story of the scholarly man Faust who, having grown
disillusioned with his philosophical and scientific knowledge, makes deals with
the devil (Mephistopheles) so that he can 'be done with peddling empty words'
and 'feel brave enough to venture forth and bear earth's torments and its
joys.'[^38] Ultimately, Faust wants to find true love; he seems to find this in
Gretchen, but the result of their relationship is ruin and shame.

Hegel's passage on *Pleasure and Necessity* therefore describes the alienated
individual's '*first purpose*': 'to become conscious of oneself as a singular
essence within that other self-consciousness, or to make this other into
itself.'[^39] This is Hegel's abstract way of describing a kind of love. The
individual desires 'the intuition of the unity of both self-sufficient
self-consciousnesses' -- for instance, the unity of Faust and Gretchen -- and is
thereby prepared to 'plunge into life'; they have abandoned 'the seemingly
heavenly spirit' of observational knowing and doing, and have succumbed to 'the
spirit of the earth'.[^40] This is a direct reference to the 'Erdgeist' in
*Faust*, which Hegel describes as 'a spirit to whom the only being which counts
as the true actuality is that of the actuality of singular consciousness.' The
individual is now concerned only with the particular, sensory things of this
world insofar as they might satisfy one's desire. Faust chooses the Earth over
Heaven because the Earth is the natural home of his body. It is for these
reasons that Kalkavage refers to pleasure-seeking individualism as 'the erotic
version of sense-certainty.'[^41]

Hegel describes the abandonment of observational reason with all the Romantic
grandeur that this individualist idolises: 'out of the motionless being of
thinking', the pleasure-seeker has 'the law of ethos and existence, together
with the skills related to observation and theory, only as a gray and gradually
vanishing shadow behind it'.[^42] 'The shadows cast by science, laws, and
principles, which alone stand between it and its own actuality, vanish like a
lifeless fog', and the Faustian individual is left with a clean slate upon which
their self-actualisation can take place.[^43]

This actualisation is, as we have established, 'a doing of *desire*.' The
amorous individualist wants to obliterate the otherness of its object (the
love-interest); this, Hegel points out, is a little different to the more
primitive form of desire in the *Self-Consciousness* chapter, which started out
by wanting to obliterate its object as such -- to consume it, destroy it, and so
on. In *Pleasure and Necessity*, desire wants to be one with the Other: to
overcome its very *Other*-ness and witness it as the 'objectified selfhood' of
the desiring individual.[^44] This witnessing is the moment of pleasure.

The pleasurable unity of lovers 'positively signifies that [the individual] has
come to be objective self-consciousness *to itself*': now that there is love,
some real satisfaction has been found.[^45] However, this satisfaction only
takes the individual to a certain point. It is limited, and its limitation is
what it shares with the desire of the *Self-Consciousness* chapter. Faust's
desire earns him some kind of relationship with Gretchen, but their relationship
never becomes something permanent and ethical: indeed, Gretchen ends up being
charged with murder after she drowns the illegitimate child she had with Faust.
Bound to Mephistopheles's pact, Faust is unable to pursue anything beyond
worldly pleasure; in Robert Stern's words, 'pleasure-seeking now appears as an
alien constraint on his happiness, a kind of external necessity or fate which
seems to destroy him.'[^46] Hegel expresses this in logical terms by saying that
the Faustian individual's practice ultimately amounts to

> the further expansion of those empty essentialities, or of pure unity, of pure
> difference, and of their relation ... the simply and empty but nonetheless
> inexorable and impassive *relation* whose work is only the nothingness of
> singular individuality.[^47]

As a consequence, Hegel explains, the pleasure-seeker's 'plunge into life' has
ultimately been reversed: the individual has 'instead plunged into the
consciousness of its own lifelessness ... as *dead* actuality.'
