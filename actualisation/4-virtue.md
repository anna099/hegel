#### Virtue and the Way of the World {#virtu}

To introduce this final stage of self-actualisation, Hegel looks at the
development of this chapter as a whole with regards to its logical
structure.[^70] In *Pleasure and Necessity*, we had a simple opposition of
individuality (the pleasure-seeker) and universality (social norms). In *The Law
of the Heart*, the structure was more complex: the Romantic represented an
'immediate unity' of individuality and universality, since the universal moral
law was derived from their individual heart. The rest of society, from the
perspective of the Romantic, represented an *opposition* of individuality and
universality: the innocent individual being repressed by the 'violent order' of
society. In the present stage of *virtue* we are confronted with a character
who, dismayed by the chaos and rampant individualism of the way of the world,
looks to *suppress* their individuality and let themselves be guided by a
universal standard of virtue. Logically, then, we find an individual who aims to
let universality *sublate* individuality; for the rest of society (those who
partake in the way of the world), universality is sublated by individuality: the
individual 'is the essence' of life.
