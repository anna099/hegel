#### Virtue and the Way of the World {#virtu}

To introduce this final stage of self-actualisation, Hegel looks at the
development of this chapter as a whole with regards to its logical
structure.[^70] In *Pleasure and Necessity*, we had a simple opposition of
individuality (the pleasure-seeker) and universality (social norms). In *The Law
of the Heart*, the structure was more complex: the Romantic represented an
'immediate unity' of individuality and universality, since the universal moral
law was derived from their individual heart. The rest of society, from the
perspective of the Romantic, represented an *opposition* of individuality and
universality: the innocent individual being repressed by the 'violent order' of
society. In the present stage of *virtue* we are confronted with a character
who, dismayed by the chaos and rampant individualism of the way of the world,
looks to *suppress* their individuality and let themselves be guided by a
universal standard of virtue. Logically, then, we find an individual who aims to
let universality *sublate* individuality; for the rest of society (those who
partake in the way of the world), universality is sublated by individuality: the
individual 'is the essence' of life.

Virtue is thus a rejection of the individualistic forms of self-actualisation
that preceded it, a rejection of the idea that the law has a relation to one's
personal whims. The position of the 'knight of virtue' is therefore rather
paradoxical: since the success of virtue is the *overcoming* of individuality,
there will be no individual to celebrate this success should it take place. The
knight of virtue 'engages with the way of the world; but its purpose and true
essence lie in *defeating the actuality* of the way of the world. As a result,
the existence of the good which is thereby brought about is the *cessation of
its doing*.'[^71] The knight of virtue is an individual against individuality.
Moreover, since the 'true essence' of virtue -- that is, a world in which
everyone is virtuous -- is not yet actual, and since it stands completely
outside the domain of individuality, the knight of virtue 'only *has faith in*'
the possibility of global virtuousness.[^72] Put together, the self-sacrificing
goal of the knight of virtue and the inherent uncertainty in this goal make
the quest for virtue a remarkably different kind of self-actualisation to the
previous two kinds.
