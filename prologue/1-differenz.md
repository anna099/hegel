## Prologue:<br>The *Differenzschrift* {#begin}

### Substance and Subject

Hegel's first widely recognised publication was named directly after its subject
matter: *The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's System of
Philosophy*.[^1] It is also known by the shorter name, *Differenzschrift*. By
engaging with these two major figures in German thought (Schelling was two years
younger than Hegel, but quicker to make a name for himself intellectually),
Hegel began to carve out his own name in the history of philosophy. A few things
can be said to elucidate the philosophical context out of which the
*Differenzschrift* was born.

As mentioned in the introduction above, Spinoza was a hugely significant figure
for German idealist philosophy. He had succeeded in constructing a philosophical
system that was entirely monistic, spiralling out from one fundamental
substance; however, he had done so at the cost of 'fatalism': in Spinoza's
universe, everything is determined. There is no room for true freedom. Now, for
Johann Gottlieb Fichte, this made Spinoza the arche-dogmatist. For Fichte, all
systems of philosophy proceed by abstracting from either one of the two
principle entities of experience: 'the thing' or 'the subject'; *dogmatism* is
Fichte's name for those systems, like Spinoza's, who put the 'thing' (or
'substance') first, and attempt to explain subjectivity's emergence out of the
substance of nature.[^2] Spinoza's dogmatism is the most honest and
sophisticated, because Spinoza readily admits that *free* subjectivity *cannot*
emerge from the substance of nature. But so much for philosophical honesty: what
good is a fatalist system when *moral freedom* is such a pressing issue of
philosophy? This line of criticism is what drove Fichte to praise Kant's
critical idealism, which -- in Fichtean terms -- started with the subject (thus
guaranteeing freedom) and then went on to establish what can be known about
things.

Had Fichte taken the project of critique to its final end? Not necessarily: for
his students (among which was a young Friedrich von Schelling) Fichte was, like
Kant, too comfortable with the antinomies in his thought. Kant had assumed that
when reason embarks on a pathway that inevitably ends in contradiction, that
pathway must be dismissed as illusory; he dismissed 'dialectic in general' as 'a
logic of illusion'.[^3] These dialectical 'antinomies' of reason led Kant to
*postulate* freedom for the sake of the moral law, since -- in his
transcendental dialectic -- he found that *both* subjective freedom and natural
necessity could be proved as the truth. Does Fichte's incommensurable division
between dogmatic rationalism and critical idealism, in the face of which the
latter must simply be *chosen*, not resemble such an antinomy? Violetta L.
Waibel argues for something like this:

> Whereas Kant judges the antinomy between causal necessity and theoretical and
> practical freedom in the *Critique of Pure Reason* as a mere illusion that
> arises because of the disregard for the scope and the boundaries of the
> theoretical domain ... we can maintain that Fichte's dialectical methodology
> is operating with a logical structure that is comparable to Kant's antinomies.
> In both theories we find an analysis of conflicting propositions, each of
> which can be shown as being a valid proposition.[^4]

To be sure, Fichte doesn't construe the divide between dogmatism and idealism as
an antinomy, and it doesn't play the same role in his system as the antinomies
do for Kant. Nonetheless, for Fichte's students it was not enough to simply
*choose* idealism over dogmatism, no matter how productive such a choice might
be. To these students, the assumption of transcendental freedom (in Kant) or the
moral decision of idealism over dogmatism (in Fichte) was 'the final form of
precritical dogmatism' in German idealism; as such, 'The antinomy between
Spinoza's doctrine of necessity and Fichte's doctrine of freedom must somehow be
resolved in some higher synthesis'.[^5] This is the problem that Schelling faced
in his 'philosophy of identity', and the problem that was on Hegel's mind at the
time of the *Differenzschrift*.

### The Thing Itself {#thing}

#### Fichte and The Spirit of Kantian Philosophy

Despite the increasing complexity of his work, Fichte always envisioned himself
to be clarifying what Kant had already established. Hegel seems to accept this
idea: in the preface to the *Differenzschrift*, he writes that 'The Kantian
philosophy needed to have its spirit distinguished from its letter, and to have
its purely speculative principle lifted out of the remainder ... it is this
principle that Fichte extracted in a purer, stricter form and called the spirit
of Kantian philosophy'.[^6] In some sense, Fichte was aiming to be more Kantian
than Kant; by doing so, he hoped to realise the *speculative* possibility within
Kant's *reflective* philosophy.

('Speculative' philosophy, for the post-Kantian idealists, is a system of
thought that can fully comprehend the relationship between God,
subjectivity, and nature. 'Reflective' philosophy which -- at least for
Schelling -- reached its apex in Kant is defined by a conviction that aspects of
this relationship are simply inaccessible to us; consequently, for the
reflective philosopher, the best we can do is to analyse (*reflect upon*) our
own understanding.)

'The principle of speculation', Hegel writes, 'is the identity of subject and
object'.[^7] However, by positing the thing-in-itself (which, according to
Hegel, is nothing but an objectification of the pure opposition between subject
and object), Kant ineluctably separates subject and object. The **reason**
(*Vernunft*) by which we would arrive at speculative identity is, for Kant,
governed and limited by the **understanding** (*Verstand*) and its twelve
categories. In Kant's work, as Hegel recalls sadly, 'the identity of subject and
object is limited to twelve acts of pure thought'.[^8] Consequently, while
*identity* (of subject and object) is the principle of speculation,
*nonidentity* is the principle of reflection.

This is how it is for Kant, at least. Fichte, on the other hand, had been
convinced by Karl Reinhold that the Kantian system, if it is to be *complete*,
must rest on a single first principle. Though Reinhold had tried to do this, he
had only discovered a foundation for Kant's *theoretical* philosophy; practical
reason remained incomplete. But what kind of principle could serve as a
grounding for both the theoretical and practical faculties of thinking? Fichte's
answer, in keeping with his primacy of the subject, is that the *act* of
'self-positing' is what serves as the foundation of *theory* (the Kantian
categories) and *practice* (practical reason). The event of the subject (the
'I') positing itself, according to Fichte, provides a basis from which all
categories can be derived (instead of merely basing them on the categories
existing in logical textbooks, as Kant had done). Furthermore, it is both a
*fact* (namely, 'I am I') and an *act* (a positing); thus, Fichte unites theory
and practice, these realms that had been so disconnected in the Kantian system,
at the very heart of his work.

In the *Differenzschrift*, Hegel writes that 'If one holds solely and directly
to this principle [i.e., I am I] and to the transcendental principle at the
basis of Kant's deduction of the categories, one has the authentic principle of
speculation boldly expressed.'[^9] However, Hegel is ultimately critical of
Fichte's system: how can the speculative principle, the unity of subject and
object, be deduced from the assertion of a self-identical *subject*? As Hegel
writes,

> The principle, the Subject-Object, turns out to be a subjective
> Subject-Object. What is deduced from it thereby gets the form of a
> conditioning of pure consciousness, of the Ego = Ego; and pure consciousness
> takes itself on the form of something conditioned by an objective infinity,
> namely the temporal progression *ad infinitum*.[^10]

In other words, Fichte never truly succeeded in overcoming Kant's subjectivism.
Yes, Fichte's system might find its foundation at a 'deeper' level than Kant
does; however, if the knowledge of objects is entirely derived from the
self-identity of an individual subject, is there not still a thing-in-itself
that lies outside of this subject, without a care for how sure of itself the
subject is?

The conclusion of this story, for Hegel, is that Fichte's system did not satisfy
*the need of philosophy*; 'one cannot say of Fichte's system that fortune has
smiled on it.' The task set for Hegel, therefore, is to heed the call of
philosophy: to fulfil

> the need for a philosophy that will recompense nature for the mishandling that
> it suffered in Kant and Fichte's systems, and set Reason itself in harmony
> with nature, not by having Reason renounce itself or become an insipid
> imitator of nature, but by Reason recasting itself into nature out of its own
> inner strength.[^11]

This is basically the task of Hegel's philosophical project as a whole. What
follows is not a thorough commentary on the *Differenzschrift*, but a sketch of
how he uses the book to introduce his project.

#### The Wrecked Ships of History {#ships}

Though Hegel is explicitly critical of Reinhold's work, he credits him with
introducing *historicity* into philosophy more explicitly than Kant had done.
For Reinhold, the task of the great philosopher was to develop 'views of one's
own' by consciously superseding the 'idiosyncratic views of one's
predecessors'. For Hegel, this does little justice to philosophy's evolution; in
fact, it amounts to little more than the disinterested accumulation of
information. Reinhold is a mere 'collector' who makes philosophy into something
neutral and indifferent regarding its objects. 'The urge toward totality
continues to express itself,' Hegel writes, 'but only as an urge toward
completeness of information'.[^12]

As Reinhold has it, the history of philosophy is a history of *personal
failures*: the philosophers have filled books with nothing more than their
opinions, and not one of them has failed to grasp the 'real truth'. However,
Hegel argues that this is likely just a projection on Reinhold's part:

> if Reinhold regards what he has recently turned to as a philosophy peculiar to
> himself, then it is indeed possible generally to regard all preceding ways of
> presenting and solving the problem of philosophy as merely personal
> idiosyncracies and mental exercises.[^13]

Truth is an island for Reinhold, 'littered with the hulks of wrecked ships' of
the past: and yet he is bold enough to assume that he is the sole captain of
thought who will make it safely to shore. For Fichte, on the other hand, the
whole history of philosophy prior to Kant is, it would seem, sunken entirely in
an ocean of falsehood; Fichte sees his system as the only true philosophy,
standing completely alone from any other.

What both Reinhold and Fichte ignored, for Hegel, was the *perennial* character
of philosophy.[^14] It is a mistake to characterise one's predecessors as merely
engaging in exercises of opinion, and it is also mistaken to simply dismiss all
prior philosophy as mere error. Instead, Hegel argues, one must 'throw oneself
into' philosophy '*à corps perdu*', and make an effort to shrug off all personal
idiosyncracies and prejudices for the sake of Reason. This might not sound like
such a radical suggestion; however, Hegel goes on to the say that the *result*
of such an approach, of casting personal idiosyncracy into 'a bottomless abyss',
is that the particular character not of the *philosopher*, but of the
philosopher's *era*, becomes explicit:

> The true peculiarity of a philosophy lies in the interesting individuality
> which is the organic shape that Reason has built for itself out of the
> material of a particular age.[^15]
