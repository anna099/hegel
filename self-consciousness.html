<h3 id="desire">Desire</h3>
<p>The <em>Phenomenology</em>’s chapter on self-consciousness marks a turning point in the book; in some sense, everything that follows is an examination of self-consciousness. At the opening of the chapter, Hegel remarks that ‘in the preceding kinds of certainty, the truth for consciousness is <em>something other than consciousness itself</em>’.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Sensuous certainty gave way to perception, which gave way to the understanding, and these overcomings occurred because ‘the concept of the truth vanishes in the experience of it’.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> That is to say, each stage of knowing posits a particular concept (whether that is the This, the One, or force) as <em>absolute</em>, certain truth. As experience undermined the truth of these concepts, eventually consciousness came to recognise <em>itself</em> as the movement of concepts. Thus, for the first time, consciousness is its own object. Just as before, consciousness is making a claim to absolute truth; this time, it asserts consciousness itself as absolute truth. The claim of self-consciousness, to start with, is therefore: <em>‘That which cannot be doubted is that I am myself.’</em></p>
<p>This is likely to remind us of Descartes’ <em>cogito</em>. But it is even more reminiscent of Kant’s idealism, which Hyppolite summarises in the formula: ‘Self-consciousness is the truth of consciousness’.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> For Kant, the only way we can possibly ascertain knowledge is if the conditions of the object are equal to the conditions of the subject; in other words, the structure of the world must match the structure of consciousness. Thus, knowledge of the world is also knowledge of the self. As Hegel himself remarked, at the end of the previous chapter, ‘there is so much self-satisfaction in explanation, because the consciousness involved in it is, to put it this way, in an immediate conversation with itself, enjoying only itself’.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> So, in ‘enjoying itself’, self-consciousness imposes itself on the whole world around it. That <em>I am myself</em> is, for self-consciousness, the highest level of truth. And yet, there is a kind of shallowness to the bare claim that <em>I am myself</em>. Far back in sensuous certainty, there was already a conception – albeit a primitive one – of the I as a This which apprehends the being of a sensuous object. In a sense, the ‘self’ had existed implicitly throughout the <em>Phenomenology</em>’s section on consciousness, if only as the hidden being who holds certainty, perceptive content, or explanations of force to be true. Does this section on self-consciousness simply develop an analysis of this hidden being, bringing it into the foreground, or is it a new kind of analysis altogether?</p>
<p>In response to this issue of the continuity between the <em>consciousness</em> and <em>self-consciousness</em> chapters, some interpretations have essentially ignored Hegel’s first three chapters, deeming them to be inessential to the <em>Phenomenology</em>’s apparently central task of philosophical anthropology.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Others have suggested that there is a close continuity from the first three chapters into the fourth. John McDowell, for example, understands the present chapter on self-consciousness as a continuation of the analysis of dependence and independence in the context of subject and object; an analysis which is indebted to Kant’s revolutionary discovery that experience is neither the independent invention or imposition of the subject, nor the passive and receptive dependency on the object. When Hegel identifies self-consciousness with desire, therefore, McDowell interprets it as a way for consciousness to incorporate that which at first is purely other; he understands the struggle for recognition as the struggle between various ways of consciousness negotiating between dependence and independence. Thus, for McDowell, this fourth chapter largely continues the project of the section on consciousness, and introduces nothing overtly social or anthropological.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>But what if we avoid such <em>allegorical</em> interpretations, and instead take Hegel at his word? At the opening of the chapter, Hegel introduces two crucial claims about self-consciousness: firstly, that insofar as it ‘<em>only</em> distinguishes <em>itself</em> from itself’, self-consciousness is merely a ‘motionless tautology’; secondly, that ‘self-consciousness is <em>desire</em>’.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> These two premises, I think, are essentially linked: the otherness that desire involves (since desire is always desire for an other) is what gives self-consciousness its <em>determinate</em> content, setting it apart from mere tautology.</p>
<h4 id="depen">Life and the Dependency of Selfhood</h4>
<p>In order for self-consciousness to actually express something beyond tautology – that is, in order for it to <em>really be</em> self-consciousness – it must recognise an Other for the sake of distinguishing itself from the Other. (We saw this same route to determinacy in <em>Perception</em>, when consciousness posited the thing as an ‘excluding One’.) Thus, ‘I am myself’ must become something like, ‘I am <em>not you</em>’. This negation of the Other is no ordinary negation, but a <em>sublation</em> – a determinate negation – that, in negating the Other, affirms the self. ‘Self-consciousness is therefore only certain of itself through the sublating of this other’.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Now, this sublation which affirms the self is, in fact, the acting-out of desire. To understand this, recall Hegel’s remark regarding animals and the Eleusinian mysteries in the first chapter of the <em>Phenomenology</em>: when animals naturally come to desire food, ‘they without further ado simply help themselves to them and devour them’; likewise, Ceres and Bacchus take up the drinks at their mysteries and ‘bring about their nothingness’.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In both scenarios, the outcome of desire is the <em>annihilation</em> of the desired object. Now, this might not seem applicable to all forms of desire: for instance, in romantic love, is the ‘annihilation’ of one’s lover really what is desired? When we are more precise, the answer turns out to be <em>yes</em>; since, to be exact, it is the <em>otherness</em> of the Other that desire seeks to annihilate: as J. N. Findlay parenthetically notes in his analysis of the <em>Phenomenology</em>, ‘The nature of desire: to abolish the otherness of the Other’.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In romantic love, the ultimate (if impossible) ambition of desire is for both lovers to become one, and see any separation between them dissolve. Furthermore, even <em>thinking</em> is a kind of desire, as I, the thinking self, negate the particularity – the otherness – of my object by subsuming it under <em>my</em> conceptualisation.</p>
<p>The process created by the acting-out of desire is <strong>life</strong>; consequently, it is with self-consciousness that we enter the ‘sphere’ of life.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The essence of self-consciousness, as it reaches out in desire in order to gaze inwards again in self-affirmation, is ‘pure movement rotating on its own axis’.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> It is both stable and in motion, just as a ball spinning on its axis stays in the same place, and yet moves in its rotation. Life as a whole takes place upon the rotating sphere of the Earth, which embodies the movement of time as it spins and moves living creatures through the infinite cycle of day and night. While the Earth – the location of all life – is both stable and in motion, so too is life (as it maintains its stability through the cycle of reproduction and death) and self-consciousness (as it remains aware of itself through the movement of desire). The sublation of desire in self-consciousness is the <em>Phenomenology</em>’s first glimpse of life.</p>
<p>At this moment, however, a dilemma arises within self-consciousness: ‘For this sublating even to be, there must be this other’.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> That is to say, the self is conscious of itself only by sublating the Other, but as soon as the Other is sublated, it is gone: there is nothing left to sublate, and therefore nothing left through which the self can identify itself. Self-consciousness must therefore constantly find a new object for its desire, for fear that it will no longer be able to assert itself. It is for this reason that Thomas Hobbes observes, as ‘a general inclination of all mankind’, ‘a perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that ceaseth only in death’.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Continual success</em> in obtaining those things which a man from time to time desireth, that is to say, continual prosperity, is that men call <span class="sc">felicity</span>; I mean the felicity of this life. For there is no such thing as perpetual tranquility of mind, while we live here; because life itself is but motion, and never can be without desire, nor without fear, no more than without sense.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="recog">Recognition</h4>
<p>What can bring an end to self-consciousness’s ‘restless desire’, and bring it toward tranquility and absolute self-affirmation? As always, we should remember the golden rule of the <em>Phenomenology</em>: that which is only for-consciousness in one moment becomes for-the-object in the next. To save itself from constant negation of its objects, therefore, self-consciousness must focus its desire on an object that negates <em>itself</em>. In Hegel’s words, ‘self-consciousness can thus only arrive at satisfaction by this object effecting the negation in itself; and the object must in itself effect this negation of itself’.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> What kind of object can negate itself? That is, what kind of being can <em>offer itself</em> to an Other, voluntarily denying its independence and recognising its dependence on other beings? Only another desiring, <em>conscious</em> being. As such, the <em>Phenomenology</em> reaches its next triumphant conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‘Self-consciousness attains its satisfaction only in another self-consciousness’</em>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The implications of this claim are enormous. For a start, it reveals that the self cannot be understood in isolation; for Hegel, to be a self is to be involved in a community of some sort. As he declares in the last paragraph of this section, ‘a <em>self-consciousness</em> is <em>for a self-consciousness</em>’.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In other words, to be an ‘I’ is to be part of a ‘we’. In addition to this, the claim also brings the concept of <strong>spirit</strong> into the present for us (‘us’ being the phenomenological observers of spirit). Spirit is the unity of subject and object, and that unity has made its appearance here, as the object of self-consciousness is (another) self-consciousness. At this point, spirit is ‘leaving behind the colorful semblance of the this-worldly sensuous, and leaving behind the empty night of the supersensible other-worldly beyond, [as] it steps into <em>the spiritual daylight of the present</em>’.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="self-sufficiency-and-non-self-sufficiency-of-self-consciousness" class="subtitle">Self-Sufficiency and Non-Self-Sufficiency of Self-Consciousness</h4>
<p>The present section is possibly the most-read passage in all of Hegel’s work, though it lasts less than ten pages. At the opening, Hegel explains that self-consciousness is only ‘<em>in</em> and <em>for itself</em>’ – that is, it is only fully manifest in its complete logical form – when it is ‘a <em>recognized</em> being’.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Hegel’s sense of recognition relies upon a typically Hegelian contradiction: it is the process by which spiritual <em>unity</em> emerges out of a <em>doubling</em>. As I understand it, this logic of recognition bears a similarity to the logic of force in the previous chapter. Recall that, in asserting itself, force reaches outside of itself and presses up against an external force. In Hyppolite’s words, force is ‘the unity of itself and its externalization’.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In the same way, ‘self-consciousness is <em>outside of itself</em>’.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Just as a force is manifest only insofar as it comes into contact with another force, so too does self-consciousness only exist insofar as it is <em>recognised to exist</em> by an Other. The process of ‘reaching out’ and being recognised is like a reflection: first, self-consciousness ‘loses itself’ in the Other, recognising them; second, it <em>sublates</em> the Other, and recognises them recognising it. Think of somebody looking into a mirror: they first recognise the image, and then they recognise that the image is an image of themselves. In both the Hegelian process of recognition, and the process of looking into a mirror, the self-consciousness returns into itself by negating the otherness (either the Other or the mirror-image). ‘It gets itself back through sublation, for it comes to be in equality with itself again through the sublation of <em>its</em> otherness’.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
