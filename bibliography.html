            <header>Primary sources by Hegel:</header>
            <li><i>The Phenomenology of Spirit</i>, translated by T. Pinkard.  (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2018).
                <p>This is the main translation I am using. The paragraph
                numbers (e.g. '§201') I refer to are given in this text, adapted
                from the numbering in Miller's translation (see below) &mdash;
                Miller created new paragraph breaks where there were none in
                Hegel's original text.</p>
            </li>
            <li><i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>, translated by A. V. Miller (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977).
                <p>This translation is also helpful to consult, not only because
                it is still widely cited in English-language Hegel scholarship,
                but also because Miller provides a useful summary of each
                paragraph at the end of the book.</p>
            </li>
            <li><i>The Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences</i>, Part I: <i>Logic</i>, translated by W. Wallace. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975).</li>
            <li><i>Elements of the Philosophy of Right</i>, translated by H. B. Nesbit. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003).</li>
            <li><i>Lectures on the History of Philosophy 1825-6</i>, Volume II: <i>Greek Philosophy</i>. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006).</li>
            <li>'On the Relationship of Skepticism to Philosophy', translated by H. S. Harris, in <i>Between Kant and Hegel: Texts in the Development of Post-Kantian Idealism</i>, edited by Harris and G. Di Giovanni. (Indianapolis, IN: Hackett, 2000).</li>
        </ul>

        <ul id="bib">
            <header>Secondary sources on the <i>Phenomenology</i>, including commentaries, etc.:</header>
            <li>H. S. Harris, <i>Hegel's Ladder</i>. (Cambridge: Hackett, 1997).
                <p>This is an ambitious commentary which goes through each
                paragraph of the <i>Phenomenology</i> and analyses the text in
                immense detail. For me, this is the best English commentary, but
                it is also the hardest.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Peter Kalkavage, <i>The Logic of Desire</i>. (Philadelphia, PA: Paul Dry Books, 2007).
                <p>Kalkavage gives a remarkably readable commentary to serve as
                an 'introduction' to the <i>Phenomenology</i>. He is
                particularly good at making explicit the references Hegel makes
                to other thinkers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Alexandre Kojève, <i>Introduction To The Reading Of Hegel</i>, translated by R. Queneau. (Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 1980).
                <p>As many later commentators have pointed out, Kojève's reading
                of Hegel is not particularly good. However, some of his work is
                worth reading for the sake of understanding the French
                intellectuals he inspired, and also because he can be
                captivating in his description of the 'characters' that appear
                in the <i>Phenomenology</i>.</p>
